She also enjoys some fresh cat grass to munch on. Amber’s favourite places for her cat naps are the cat tree and her cat bed. If they are near the window, that’s even better – she loves to watch the birds and squirrels doing bird and squirrel stuff outside. Amber’s favourite toys are the laser light and cat nip toys. She is an amazing high jumper, reaching incredible heights to get that elusive red dot. Amber loves it when you spend time brushing her or massaging her back and will purr the entire time. While she may not be a lap cat yet, Amber is starting to lounge on the bed with foster mom as her comfort level grows daily. Her calm disposition shows she has the potential to become a lap cat with time. Amber gets along with other cats and would love to have another cat friend in her new home.

As a former colony cat, Amelia employed all the survivalist tactics she could during her exploratory years in the great outdoors. But one day while reflecting on her history of exciting adventures, she decided she was ready for a new journey that included pampering, comfort, and a safe indoor home. Amelia was then “whiskered” away to the coveted 5-paw luxury Hotel of EHS and, after being adopted in 2021, she has returned to our shelter due to no fault of her own. This intrepid gal is now ready for a permanent retreat in a warm, welcoming, indoor situation with a loving and devoted family.<br />\n<br />\nThis fearless feline believes she has earned the right to enjoy some creature comforts, and we agree! Her first indoor adventures with her original foster family consisted of hiding in secret caves and jumping to/from windowsills. It was evident this curious explorer was showing progress adapting to indoor living as she began charting new territory in her apartment. <br />\n<br />\nNow that she is back at EHS, she is making exceptional progress and is described as sweet and affectionate by her concierges (aka volunteers). Upon entering her luxury suite, they are greeted with Amelia’s fluffy belly as she will regularly roll over, make air biscuits, and demand pets from those she has grown to trust. She is becoming quite the social butterfly, mingling and enjoying some daily social time with both people and her elite cat companions. She is no longer startled by loud noises or commotion, but will still exercise caution when meeting new humans, and she appreciates slower, predictable movements when being greeted by strangers.  <br />\n<br />\nAmelia is an accomplished graduate of the EHS cat socialization program, where dedicated volunteers helped her develop trust with humans and increase her confidence. Her ideal adopter will need to support her in maintaining her progress through gentle encouragement and respecting her boundaries, Given her history of being a bit timid, Amelia would likely do best in a quiet home, without dogs or small children. She does, however, quite enjoy the company of other cats, and a friendly, compatible feline (or two!) may help her settle into her forever home more easily.<br />\n<br />\nAre you ready to be a passenger on adorable Amelia’s future adventures? If so, fill out an adoption application today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...or, double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. <br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Amelia?

She also finds joy in the humble cardboard scratcher, a simple scratching post, and cat dancers.<br />\n<br />\nAnastasia seeks an experienced adopter of royal caliber - one who appreciates her independent spirit and respects her boundaries. While she may not grant the gift of pets or cuddles, her willingness to share her space speaks volumes of her generous spirit. She will require much patience and understanding as she acclimates to her new domain and in time will grace her chosen companion with the privilege of her presence, basking in their company from a distance. For those with the wisdom to accept her on her own terms, Anastasia promises a companionship as unique and cherished as the crown jewels themselves.<br />\n<br />\nAnastasia has mild tartar and will likely need a dental cleaning in 2025.

They have since been adopted and now it’s time for Aroura to find her forever family. She is the sweetest little thing, though shy with new people. She has bonded to her foster mom but is still skittish around new people. Her outdoor experience instilled caution, a natural product of living an uncertain life, but once she opens up and trusts, she is the most darling girl!<br />\n<br />\nShe and her foster brother are quite the pair and have been “dating” - Aroura enjoys all the affection he dotes upon her! She needs a cat buddy like him in her forever home to help her continue to build confidence, and have a companion as she thrives on being around other cats. He is helping her become her best self and plays with her and grooms her constantly. They are very adorable!  <br />\n<br />\nAroura is very active at night when the humans are sleeping and loves to play with both of her foster brothers. She enjoys lots of self-play time including with her squeaky mouse. She loves catnip and will chew on it and roll around like an adorable silly girl! She also likes ribbon toy wands but is less interested in interactive play than self-play. <br />\n<br />\nShe will sit on on a pillow on her foster’s lap and enjoy some cuddles for a short while, but her preference is to sit next to her foster mom and enjoy affection on her own terms; sometimes needing a little encouragement, but always with complete enjoyment once she relaxes into the petting hand. Occasionally, she will even ask for belly rubs! Aroura loves to be brushed and this is a good way to bond with her. She is ok to be picked up by her foster mom but only for a short while and on her own terms,<br />\n<br />\nAroura loves cat trees and towers with good, sturdy scratching posts so this is a must in her forever home. She LOVES birdwatching on YouTube channels, especially Birder King! She cuddles in her comfy, cozy covered bed so one of these would be perfect for her; it also gives her a safe space to “hide” when she feels overwhelmed or when adjusting to a new space.<br />\n<br />\nShe has a healthy appetite and eats her dry and wet food well. She loves all treats but especially the creamy tube treats — this is a sure way into her heart!<br />\n<br />\nBecause she is skittish, she would do best in a quieter home without small children. She got along with the two foster cats but has not lived with dogs in foster.

Ash is a big, friendly guy and so happy to be finally living the good life as a house-cat. Once comfortable in his space and familiar with the faces, he becomes a magnet as soon as he sees you, purring and leaning in to rub against your leg. This is an invitation for full body rubs and head scratches, but his absolute favourite is getting a nice, satisfying shoulder scratch. Although not a lap cat yet, the potential is definitely there in the making. <br />\n<br />\nAsh is very playful and together with his buddies at the adoption centre, can get quite rambunctious. Ash’s favourite activities are chasing balls — preferably a ping pong ball — jumping for his wand toy, and playing and cuddling with Pepper. He gets along incredibly well with other cats, so much so that he believes he should have a share of their food too!. Supervision during meal time is definitely needed to keep Ash from being a food pirate. He is a very clean boy and has excellent litter box habits. This sweetheart is hoping he can be adopted with Pepper, but since he is Mr. Congeniality, making a new friend is quite okay too.

She prefers to find and use toys all by herself, but is learning to have good playtime with people too. Even if she’s shy around you, you’ll definitely know when she’s playing — she will meow with pride and triumph once she finally “catches” her prey!<br />\n<br />\nBanana would do best in a home with other cats who are relatively calm.

If u like having the softest bundle of fur to sleep with you, Boshi will accommodate you and sleep along your back. If he needs more space he does not mind pushing you with his paws to make room so he can sprawl. One other thing about sleeping with Boshi, if he has found his position/spot DO NOT even think about moving him, you will be given a look. <br />\n<br />\nThe “spring” is his favourite toy, he is also very good with the track ball turntable (highly intelligent). Relaxing pastime, this handsome lad also enjoys sun tanning, watching the birds and squirrels outside his window.  <br />\n<br />\nIDEAL HOME ENVIRONMENT: Boshi will need to be the only pet as he is easily stimulated, this then causes him a great deal of stress.

How would that story go? We’re glad you asked!<br />\n<br />\nBen Catflick and Catt Damon are a pair of inseparable brothers who embody charm, grace, and a deep bond forged through their shared history. Surrendered due to unfortunate circumstances when their elderly owner fell ill, these two feline brothers are looking for a new forever home where they can continue their journey together.<br />\n<br />\nBorn to a stray mother who found shelter and care on a kind person&#039;s doorstep, Ben and Catt were raised together, with love, from the very beginning. Ben, with his striking tabby fur, and Catt, boasting a handsome coat of orange and white, are both stunning in their own right. Their appearances may differ, but their personalities harmonize beautifully.<br />\n<br />\nConfidence exudes from both Ben and Catt, evident in their calm and gentle demeanour. They are affectionate souls who thrive on human interaction, often seeking out cuddles and pets from anyone willing to give them attention. Known for their loving nature, they melt hearts with their gentle purrs and the way they nuzzle close for comfort.<br />\n<br />\nBen and Catt enjoy simple pleasures like lounging in a sunbeam, their fur glowing warmly in the light, or perching contentedly by a window, watching the world outside with curious eyes. They share a playful spirit, delighting in chasing after toy mice and batting around colourful balls, their brotherly camaraderie evident in their synchronized movements and joyful antics.<br />\n<br />\nBut like any good story, this one comes with an emotional twist. A recent vet checkup determined that Ben has a mass in his lung, which is likely cancerous, as well as hyperthyroidism. As such, he will remain a palliative foster cat, with EHS taking full responsibility for his ongoing medical care, while his brother Catt will be a straightforward adoption.<br />\n<br />\nWhat Ben Catflick and Catt Damon crave most of all is a loving home where they can continue to thrive together, sharing their boundless love and companionship with a family who appreciates their gentle souls and playful spirits. Adopting Catt means welcoming not just one, but two affectionate hearts into your home, as you will also be agreeing to provide palliative foster care to Ben. Think of it as a double dose of feline joy, filling your life with warmth and happiness!<br />\n<br />\nIf you feel your home is the right fit for these two handsome, superstar brothers, please apply to adopt Catt and foster Ben, today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

But this extroverted and playful pussycat certainly isn&#039;t snooty towards people! Billy follows his foster mother everywhere, trotting two steps behind as she moves from room to room, then settling beside her wherever she sits down. Billy is also attached to his foster dad, and often sleeps at his feet. Billy is not shy about asking for affection, either—he&#039;ll headbutt you until you give him the pets he deserves. If he thinks you&#039;re not listening, he might even try a chirp or two to get your attention.<br />\n<br />\nBilly has had to overcome some hurdles to reach his bubbly new potential. He spent much of his life homeless, roving the streets of Hamilton, enjoying few social interactions. He was a tad reclusive after arriving at EHS, although he came out of his shell eventually. After moving into his foster home, Billy was a bit wary and spent a few days hiding. However, after getting to know his foster parents, he has settled in and flourished.<br />\n<br />\nBilly loves to socialize by playing, and his favourite toy is a wand with a ribbon, which he likes to chase around. Billy is also happy playing on his own. Lately, he&#039;s developed a fetish for bags—he pounces on each one he sees and then hunkers down on it. (When Billy goes missing, his foster mom looks inside the bags!) The guest room is the other possibility—Billy&#039;s claimed this space for nap time.)<br />\n<br />\nIf you were to ignore this resilient cat&#039;s ability to thrive, you&#039;d be a &quot;Silly Billy.&quot; This genial gentleman has great potential to continue his renaissance in a forever home. He would probably be best suited to lodgings without small children, and we aren&#039;t sure how Billy feels about dogs.

Introducing the always beautiful Cece!<br />\n<br />\nCece may be unaware of her own beauty (as her name suggests in Latin), but she sure knows how to pour on the charm! This darling diva could easily be called &quot;CC&quot; (for Companion Cat) as she wants nothing more than love and attention from her humans. So bring on the pets, cuddles, and lap time, and don&#039;t forget your blankets!<br />\n<br />\nNever afraid to speak up, Cece is a chatty cat for food (and attention) and will happily remind you when it&#039;s time for breakfast. Once satiated, she will spend most of her morning snoozing in the sun or on your bed. Gentle and friendly, Cece loves to play, whether it&#039;s chasing toys on her own or with her foster parents. This playful gal has recently discovered the fun of a food ball, which rewards her with treats every time she bats it around. When not playing or having the zoomies, Cece enjoys lounging from a perch up high (furniture, cat trees, or tabletops) and snuggling with her pillows (she&#039;s an expert biscuit maker!). On laundry day, Cece adores having warm laundry on the bed for her to sleep on. Make sure you&#039;re constantly listening to what she has to say, as Cece can&#039;t get enough of &quot;tub time,&quot; and will ask you to turn on the faucet in the bathtub so that she can drink and play in the water!<br />\n<br />\nThis snuggly gal is great with all people, even strangers! Cece is a loving and loyal girl. She would do well in a home with a family where at least one person is present most of the time.

Cinnamon was surrendered to a shelter there before coming to EHS, although not much is known of her past or the reasons for her surrender. Happily, Cinnamon has put her past behind her, and now this gorgeous girl is waiting for her chance to spice up the right family or person&#039;s life!<br />\n <br />\nAlthough Cinnamon is still timid, progress is being made in small but significant steps. Inch by inch, Cinnamon is becoming more comfortable with humans being in close proximity to her, and is beginning to welcome some chin scratches with the back-scratcher. Despite this, Cinnamon has a lot of love to give when she feels comfortable in her environment. In her previous foster home, she would actively search for her foster parent when it was time for her meals, and she would enjoy playing with them, lounging next to them, and being petted by them. With her unique and utterly adorable meow, she lets her humans know when her tummy yearns for delicious sustenance. The sound is so endearing that it’s hard not to immediately respond to her requests! And when Cinnamon feels relaxed, she often climbs her cat tree to watch the people and world outside her window, resting with one leg elegantly extended. To activate her playful side, you just need to engage her in an epic battle with any wand toy, and soon she&#039;ll be displaying her agility and grace!<br />\n<br />\nLike most other cats, a change in environments can cause Cinnamon&#039;s confidence to regress, so potential adopters should be prepared for this and have plenty of patience and understanding for her as she adjusts to her new home. We are unsure how she would react in a household with dogs or small children, but currently, she is sharing a room with a few other cats at the shelter. While she doesn&#039;t appear to interact with them much, she doesn&#039;t seem too bothered by them, either. <br />\n<br />\nCinnamon is a skittish cat who has had minimal experience with humans. She is currently enrolled in EHS’s socialization program, where dedicated volunteers are working to help her become more comfortable around people. There have been many successful graduates from this program, but potential adopters should be prepared to commit the time, effort, and patience required to help Cinnamon along this journey. It should be noted that while some skittish cats might remain reserved, others may express their trust and affection in a variety of ways. A skittish cat will benefit from a calm, quiet environment, preferably without small children. EHS will provide post-adoption support to assist Cinnamon with a successful transition to her forever home.<br />\n <br />\nCinnamon the spice is known for its wonderful health benefits, but Cinnamon the cat is looking to add a little bit of spice to your life! Will you open your home and heart to Cinnamon and give her all the love and care she needs?<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

She picked the right house to give birth to her babies on a cold March day. Thankfully, the house owner noticed that a cat was hiding her babies in his backyard bushes, so he contacted a cat rescue and was able to get a trap set up in the early morning of a very snowy day. To protect her babies, Cora sat wary and hungry until that evening, when hunger finally drove her to walk into the trap. A few short hours later, she and her babies were in a warm house where she never have to worry about food or shelter for herself and her babies again. <br />\n<br />\nCora is not only a caring and protective mama to her own kittens, her maternal love extended to becoming the surrogate mama to 3 orphaned, 2-week-old kittens who also came into AVA’s care needing a nursing mom. She raised her babies until they were about 6 weeks old, then accepted the orphaned kittens and cared for them like they were her own. Now all her babies are big and strong, and all had found forever homes, it’s time for Cora to find a forever family of her own too. <br />\n<br />\nCora’s outside experience was no doubt fraught with danger and hunger, so the memory of it makes her a cautious and wary cat. With a lot of patient coaxing and gentle, loving approaches, her foster mom is slowly dismantling the defensive walls Cora has built around her safe zone. She has started to come closer to the hand offering Temptations treats, and after watching the crazy antics of the kittens playing, has also started to play with toys and engage with other cats. <br />\n<br />\nShe is looking for a family who has had some experience with a shy cat, and can understand that Cora’s wary behaviour is a residual result of her remembered past, and give her the time she needs to come out of her shell. With patience, love and lots of treats, that can be a rewarding reality sooner than you think! Cora would love to join her forever family with some of the friends she made at the adoption centre, or join a home with other friendly cats who can show her that living with people in a safe, warm and loving space is far more preferable than what she had before, and settle down to live the best life possible, safe and sound at last.<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Cora a part of your family?

She took her time to warm up and show us her beautiful petals, and just like a late-blooming flower, there is more to unravel. Now that the summer heat is here, Daisy is in search of a homey garden where she can lay down her roots. This little flower has been preparing to be repotted and all she needs now is a caring family to help her blossom!<br />\n<br />\nOnce a slow-growing pod, Daisy is now a flower waiting to be displayed. She has been working on her people skills, getting more comfortable and adjusting to human company. This flower is known to sniff hands and curiously snoop, observing from a distance everything that&#039;s happening. She&#039;s certainly a curious soul! Though she may initially shy away from direct contact, it&#039;s only because she needs to be familiar with you and her surroundings. Daisy allows pets from those she trusts, purring in their company, and is comfortable when in a familiar environment where she can confidently explore. When going to the vet, this flower becomes shy and will avoid you (thinking you&#039;re a traitor), but she always warms up and opens her petals again when back on home turf! Some flowers can&#039;t be forced to bloom, and Daisy will require patience, and a bit of work for her to fully blossom into her true self! Luckily, this vibrant fireball has an adorably expressive face, which makes it easy to gauge her comfort level!<br />\n<br />\nDespite her initially shying away from physical contact, Daisy is very sweet and gentle. Tasty treats and playtime are the best ways to get on her good side. She thrives on playful interactions, rolling around on the floor to get anyone&#039;s attention. Daisy loves to whack at the wand and spring toys, even delighting in games of chase with the laser pointer, attacking, sliding, and spinning to catch it under her fluffy paws. Any toy will do the trick! There is never a time when this flower isn&#039;t curious, as she has been known to stare at her foster while they&#039;re blow drying their hair, and she even sniffs people&#039;s feet (just making sure they&#039;re clean!). Reflecting the lifestyle of a flower, her other hobbies include people and bird watching from the window, gazing at her gorgeous self in the mirror, and sleeping in late on weekends.<br />\n<br />\nDaisy finds solace in the company of other feline friends, sharing an occasional nap or playing with her resident companions. She&#039;s even been known to groom her foster&#039;s dog once in a while! Yet, there are times when she would rather ignore them (some alone time is always nice, too). A quiet home without small children would be the best place for Daisy to flourish; she doesn&#039;t want children stomping around in her space. We should also note that Daisy has inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is well controlled by a lifelong, daily medication and special diet. This good girl happily takes her medicine in a pill pocket, like a treat!<br />\n<br />\nDaisy is searching for a permanent garden to establish her roots and bloom into the radiant flower we know she is. If you have the nurturing touch to help her thrive, submit your adoption application!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300.

We hope that you give us a chance to win you over, as we both make great companions and have so much love to give!<br />\n<br />\nThere is nothing that Fox and I love more than to be affectionate and to cuddle with you. Fox LOVES to have his belly rubbed, and so do I - but chin and head scratches are my all-time favourite! I simply cant get enough! Im also a major foodie at heart - I enjoy gobbling up as much wet food as I can, and will even sometimes sneak bites of my brother&#039;s dental food when my foster mom is not looking!<br />\n<br />\nLike a typical brother-sister duo, at times Fox and I can antagonise or annoy each other. Sometimes we hiss, hide from, or ignore the other, but we both know deep down that we cant live without our beloved sibling. In terms of our purr-sonalities, I am bolder and comfortable around strangers, where it can take Fox a bit more time to trust and to transform into the snuggle bug that he is. Fox enjoys running around the house with wand toys in his mouth, whereas I am more food-focused and will only bat at a toy if its dangled right in front of me! Fox can be a tad clumsy and will trip over his own feet often during play, but that only adds to his cute and goofy charm!<br />\n<br />\nIn terms of our health, we promise you that its all very manageable! I am on a yummy special diet for IBD, and take a puffer each morning for my asthma. Fox is also asthmatic, but he has not required medication for a long time - lucky duck! He is given epilepsy medication twice a day through a pill gun, which he takes like a champ! After having our lives turned upside down, Fox and I are both ready for a loving home where we can finally feel secure and enjoy our days as cherished members of a fur-ever family.

Initially hesitant and afraid of his new environment, David has completely opened up in his foster home. Life in foster has allowed him to connect with his inner kitten and he enjoys playing with toys; some of his favourites include the cat dancer, crinkle ball, ribbon wand, and laser pointer. A food-motivated boy, he will often drop by the kitchen to see what&#039;s cooking (and perhaps serenade you with his stellar vocals), and in the morning, he will jump up on his foster parents&#039; bed to let them know it is time for breakfast. <br />\n<br />\nThis former scaredy-cat turned lap-cat absolutely loves being near his people and being brushed for hours, which causes him to purr (and drool) in contentment. He is a creature of habit and likes sunning himself by the window in the morning, napping in the afternoon, and playing in the evening. A quiet, adult-only home with no other pets would best support David as loud noises still startle him from time to time, and it takes him a while to warm up to strangers. Once he has warmed up to you, though, he&#039;ll love you for life! <br />\n<br />\nDavid has FIV, which is a virus that weakens the immune system of a cat. It is not transmissible to humans or other species. Cats who have FIV can live just as long as other cats if they are properly cared for, with a good diet, an indoor home, a loving family, and vet checkups twice a year. David also lives with stage 2 kidney disease which is easily managed with a special diet.

Dior the cat, that is.<br />\n<br />\nThrough no fault of his own, our stylish boy made the trip from the House of Dior to EHS. Currently relaxing in a foster home, far from the world&#039;s runways, Dior seems to prefer a more subdued lifestyle--no limelight for this guy! Although Dior is by no means a cat of haute couture, his &quot;cat-ure&quot; is quite a fashionable piece. From his chic, grey and white tabby coat, to his pristine white boots, he definitely wears his attire well--he is one handsome &quot;monsieur.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nHis foster parent describes Dior as friendly and playful. He actively seeks affection with head bonks, and enjoys chasing various toys. A good game of fetch or a friendly game of tag are some of his favourite pastimes. During these sessions, he occasionally offers playful nips, but he means no harm! When Dior wishes to move on and strut his stuff, he might give a gentle swat. Like many cats, if he feels his initial request for space is being ignored, he may scratch or give a gentle warning bite.<br />\n<br />\n <br />\nBesides engaging in play, Dior loves his food and is not shy about meowing in case you might have forgotten the time. He also has a keen interest as to what is on your plate. It seems that Dior enjoys “the high life,” regularly using counters, the kitchen table, and the top of the fridge as his catwalks. In his new home, he would likely appreciate his own perch where he can chill and survey the world around him. When not “in action,” Dior can be found looking out the window, and will stop his playing to curl up and sleep by your side at night.<br />\n<br />\nDior will do best in a home with an experienced cat owner who will be able to read his body language and respect his boundaries. As previous interactions with felines have been less than cordial, Dior wants to rule as an only cat in a quiet household with no small children. It is unknown if he has encountered dogs, so it&#039;s best they stay out of this mix.<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to be the one to offer Dior a runway of his very own? Once launched, he will add his very own flair, and provide love and companionship in his unique style. Contact EHS today to find out more about our charming boy. <br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...or, double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption.  <br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Dior?

The boy who stole thousands of hearts with his heart-wrenching story is ready for adoption! Drake, our tripod love bug, is ready for his forever home at last. Seven-year-old Drake is calm, friendly, and quiet. His favourite places to be are in the kitchen, where he can perch himself on a chair (or two) or on the couch, and do his favourite things: relax, sleep, and watch everyone and everything happening around him. Drake loves people and he loves to cuddle. He is ok being picked up, but you will need two hands to lift him, as this boy is a bit of a unit, carrying a few (ok several) extra pounds. But that just means there’s more of him to love! Drake isn’t much for playing, nor does he seek the attention of other cats. He prefers the company of people, especially those who share his fondness for the quiet life. Drake is having no issues at all navigating as a tripod. The only thing he can’t do properly is bury his poop, which is understandable, right? Picture a very rotund cat pooping on three legs, then trying to bury with one – it’s not happening. Drake eats a variety of foods, and he loves his Temptations. However, it would be very beneficial if his new family could continue to help him on his weight loss journey, as it will be much easier for him to navigate life on three legs with less weight to support. Drake’s ideal home will be quiet, without young kids or kittens, and someone home most of the time. A condo or bungalow will be preferable as stairs will be difficult for him. With a proper introduction and the expectation of a few initial hisses, Drake gets along with other quiet, non-dominant cats, but would be just as happy on his own. <br />\n <br />\nDrake was discarded outside by his human and sadly hit by a car, where his guardian angel saw him lying on the side of the road. He almost didn’t stop, fearing the worst. But when saw his head move, he stopped immediately and rushed him to the ER. Drake’s story was shared on social media in the hopes of finding an owner. We saw it and instantly knew we had to help. Drake was taken to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation, and the recommendation was to undergo amputation. Drake is lucky that is the only injury he sustained. <br />\n <br />\nDrake has been through enough. He is ready to find the perfect home to spend the rest of his life, loved unconditionally. All he wants is a home with a quiet, relaxing atmosphere and people to give him all the cuddles and love he deserves. Is that home with you?<br />\n\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/e118fee2-9fcf-487f-bb6a-169246e84620/image/7c0cc96c-e159-4004-8e69-159629fb7afa.jpg?versionId=uLFu6ZxWbaB1SNCyjhBf7zknl7ivIwEv&amp;bust=1721134958&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/drake-71699595/on/etobicoke/home-at-last-rescue-on624/","traits":{"playful":1,"affectionate":4,"sociable":2,"independent":4,"adventurous":0}},"edith-happy-single-71314211.json":{"id":"edith-happy-single-71314211","characteristics":"Yes","name":"edith (happy single)","desc":"DOB: 2012<br />\nEdith is a lovely senior gal who has a cute face and a cute soft purr.

A home of his own! Elf is only three years old and has been visited by the Grinch far too often in his short life. Elf was considered feral when he first came into our care, but his foster mom knew otherwise! Elf is a bit shy and will take some time to settle down and be comfortable with new people, but then you will be gifted with a friendly “Velcro” cat, who will even let you pick him up to kiss his face with a slow approach. Elf is a playful boy and has learned that the cat scratcher, crinkle balls and wand toys are the best! He also likes to chase the broom, followed up with a snack of minnow treats. When he is comfortable with you, you will learn how much of a talker he can be. Elf is not aggressive in any way but will let out a non-threatening hiss or give a little slap just to let you know he’s unsure or nervous about something. Elf is also FELV positive. His condition is regressive, which means he is not contagious at this point. And if that’s not enough, Elf arrived with a hematoma in his ear, which required surgery. His ear requires as-needed cleanings with ear solution or wipes, as his ear canal is so narrow it doesn’t breathe or empty as other cats’ ears do. Unfortunately, surgery for the canal isn’t an option because of his FELV status. The process of medicating him daily, helped him realize he was safe with his foster mom and helped their relationship progress faster. He is interested in other cats and can live quite comfortably with another FELV cat looking for a friend. <br />\n<br />\nElf came to us from animal services, where he was scheduled to be euthanized. His foster mom saw him and knew she had to help him. Elf is now ready to find his forever home, thanks to the incredible progress made with his foster mom.  <br />\n<br />\nElf isn’t going to love you right away. But he isn’t going to hurt you either. He needs the perfect person to realize his potential and has the patience to work with him. Elf needs someone who will take a slow, soft approach to let him know he is safe. That&#039;s the only thing on his Christmas list - a loving and caring home. In return, you will have the gift of his undivided love and the satisfaction of knowing that you gave him the best gift ever - a home filled with love and care.<br />\n\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/bd6ab139-4cfc-495c-95d0-b63e85083f61/image/c13ca921-57d4-4310-bb82-ebae7c7ec94b.jpg?versionId=n_0Qdg7iWQRgUFPMjbn6Tkbbpwydnh14&amp;bust=1714138138&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/elf-71460757/on/etobicoke/home-at-last-rescue-on624/","traits":{"playful":4,"affectionate":5,"sociable":3,"independent":3,"adventurous":1}},"elijah-70986289.json":{"id":"elijah-70986289","characteristics":"Long","name":"elijah","desc":"Name:ELJAY <br />\nBreed:Persian mix <br />\nSex:male <br />\nAge:2 years <br />\nEnergy level?

This beautiful tabby girl came to EHS from another shelter with her daughter, Robyn, who has already found a forever home. While we don&#039;t know much about Emma&#039;s past, we have learned a lot about her since she’s been in our care, and she’s become a bit of an EHS celebrity! <br />\n<br />\nEmma has been with us for quite some time now, but she’s come a long way since arriving at our shelter! Through the efforts of caring volunteers, Emma&#039;s confidence has blossomed with those she’s come to know and trust. The combination of patience, time, and the back-scratcher have served as her bridge to connection; she has been observed rolling around and showing her belly off in exchange for some scratches. She’s very good at communicating her preferences to people: approach her too quickly and she’ll hiss and swat, but with a calm approach she’ll hide her cute little face away and allow you to proceed, accepting the gentle touch of affection on her back, cheeks, and chin. With a bit of time and trust-building Emma enjoys pets by hand, including full-body rubs and even some gentle butt scratches! She also appreciates it when people ask her “May I pet you?” before trying to proceed. With her trusted friends at the shelter she leans into pets, purring in enjoyment, and sleeping (and snoring) peacefully in their presence. Emma’s simply a particular girl, and she knows what she likes—no approaching from above or touching her forehead, thankyouverymuch! The occasional tube treat has also been found to help win her over.<br />\n<br />\nA large contributor to her confidence is that Emma particularly enjoys the company of male cats! Over the past few months, Emma has “flirted” with several EHS fellas who have since been adopted. Volunteers have enjoyed watching her confidently interact with these boys! (Check out our Instagram account to view her “love” stories and see if she’ll beguile one, or even two, in return.) She seems to have the magic touch to help her friends find forever homes, while she patiently waits for one of her own. <br />\n<br />\nA dream home for Emma would be one where a friendly male feline already resides, or one with plans to adopt her alongside a male cat friend (just ask us to recommend her favourite matches!). Emma is currently enrolled in EHS’s socialization program, where dedicated volunteers are working to help Emma become more comfortable around people. There have been many successful graduates from this program, but potential adopters should be prepared to commit the time, effort, and patience required to help Emma along this journey. It should be noted that while some skittish cats might remain reserved, others may express their trust and affection in a variety of ways. A skittish cat will benefit from a calm, quiet environment, preferably without small children. EHS will provide post-adoption support to assist Emma with a successful transition to her forever home. <br />\n<br />\nEmma is emerging as a diamond in the rough, her sparkle revealed by the polish of love and understanding. Will you help Emma continue to shine? Please submit an adoption application today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

The two cats were originally part of a cat colony, where Ernest earnestly tried to survive through his wits and stunning good looks alone. Luckily, the boys made their way out of the colony and now Ernest understands what human kindness is all about. <br />\n<br />\nErnest and his brother are currently in a foster home, thriving as indoor cats and receiving plenty of attention and socialization. Ernest is more reserved than Hemingway, preferring to receive affection by hand on his terms or enjoying a good scratch with the back-scratcher. Ernest has made excellent progress by actively seeking affection from his foster mom by rubbing up against her, purring, and even allowing her to rub his tummy. He loves to cuddle with his brother and they take turns grooming each other. Ernest is very playful with his brother, but also enjoys solo play, whether it’s with feather toys, balls, or mice—and sometimes a good sprint down the hallway to burn off some energy! When he craves alone time, he will hang out on top of the cat tree, either having a snooze or gazing out the window, pondering life. He also can’t resist a relaxing brushing session. His foster mom describes him as quirky, curious, and smart—he even knows his name and will respond when called! <br />\n<br />\nEven though Ernest may take his time to trust humans, he already trusts and loves his brother, Hemingway. These boys will need a patient owner to help them write their next chapter. Their history with small children and dogs is unknown, but this ginger duo currently shares a foster home with other feline-friendly cats and gets along well with them.<br />\n<br />\nErnest Hemingway had this to say about cats: “A cat has absolute emotional honesty: human beings, for one reason or another, may hide their feelings, but a cat does not.” If you&#039;re trustworthy and looking for two emotionally honest cats to complement your life, please submit an application for Ernest and his brother Hemingway, today! <br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

It soon became clear that this tired, young mum needed a break from her rambunctious babies, so she booked herself a solo staycation in EHS’s foster program.  This tantalizing tabby has been settling in quickly with her foster family, enjoying a little R &amp; R, gaining confidence, and becoming more comfortable with human interaction and affection. <br />\n<br />\nDespite her fiery name, Etna is a sweet, quiet girl who has realized that some things in life are worth purring for, especially things like head and chin rubs! According to her foster, Etna has discovered the art of being pampered and will venture out of her hiding spots, loafing about and purring for affection. She will actively seek attention, begging for pets, and will often flip belly up and “swim” in the air (making biscuits). This gorgeous gal has earned the right to be doted on and will gladly offer a few head bonks as a reminder that it&#039;s time for a chin rub (or three)! Her foster has also reported that she’s becoming more outgoing and always greets her family with loving affection.<br />\n<br />\nEtna’s interaction with other cats is limited, and her exposure to other pets and young children is unknown. Her foster notes that she ignores the other household cats when in their presence and although she does not seem bothered by them, she isn’t interested in becoming friends. Etna is a quiet girl and her ideal home is one where she is the only pet, with no young children. She is ready to upgrade to a permanent staycation filled with love, patience, socialization, and a willingness to meet her adorable pampering demands.<br />\n<br />\nEtna wants to head bonk her way into your heart!

Im Dana, a sweet and friendly calico seeking a loving home with my younger brother, Fox. We sadly came back to Team Cat Rescue after seven years together in an adoptive home. Though my brother and I have been passed over for adoption many times, we do not lose hope that our next fur-ever family is just around the corner! We hope that you give us a chance to win you over, as we both make great companions and have so much love to give!<br />\n<br />\nThere is nothing that Fox and I love more than to be affectionate and to cuddle with you. Fox LOVES to have his belly rubbed, and so do I - but chin and head scratches are my all-time favourite! I simply cant get enough! Im also a major foodie at heart - I enjoy gobbling up as much wet food as I can, and will even sometimes sneak bites of my brother&#039;s dental food when my foster mom is not looking!<br />\n<br />\nLike a typical brother-sister duo, at times Fox and I can antagonise or annoy each other. Sometimes we hiss, hide from, or ignore the other, but we both know deep down that we cant live without our beloved sibling. In terms of our purr-sonalities, I am bolder and comfortable around strangers, where it can take Fox a bit more time to trust and to transform into the snuggle bug that he is. Fox enjoys running around the house with wand toys in his mouth, whereas I am more food-focused and will only bat at a toy if its dangled right in front of me! Fox can be a tad clumsy and will trip over his own feet often during play, but that only adds to his cute and goofy charm!<br />\n<br />\nIn terms of our health, we promise you that its all very manageable! I am on a yummy special diet for IBD, and take a puffer each morning for my asthma. Fox is also asthmatic, but he has not required medication for a long time - lucky duck! He is given epilepsy medication twice a day through a pill gun, which he takes like a champ! After having our lives turned upside down, Fox and I are both ready for a loving home where we can finally feel secure and enjoy our days as cherished members of a fur-ever family.

When his curiosity is (momentarily) satisfied, Fred will happily lean into (and even doze off during) pets and scratches--sometimes even rolling over onto his back for belly rubs!<br />\n<br />\nThe ideal home for Fred is where he will be the only pet.

Genie has been described as an “adorable lap cat” who would spend her whole day being brushed and petted if possible. When Genie’s not lounging around lapping up affection, she loves to play with toy wands. Might she think they have a bit of magic, too? <br />\n<br />\nVolunteers report that Genie is a chatty girl! She likes to “talk” to anyone who is around and relishes in the attention by giving lots of cat hugs and lap cuddles. Genie gets her beauty sleep in her own bed or on the sofa, graciously allowing her masters a bit of space at night. However, “dreaming of Genie” is still very much encouraged. <br />\n<br />\nThis gorgeous tabby girl took the long way to EHS, starting her life in India where she was rescued by a loving family. Unfortunately, Genie wanted to be the only one for her master and was less-than-magical to the three other cats in the home. This genie does not want to share her lamp! <br />\n<br />\nGiven Genie’s past, she should be the only cat in the home. A home without dogs and young children would also be best, as she has not been exposed to either. <br />\n<br />\nAre you ready to add a little magic to your life? Why not consider Genie? You might be the answer to her wish, and she to yours! <br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...or, double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Genie? It&#039;s easy! Just click &quot;Adopt a Cat&quot; on the EHS website (etobicokehumanesociety.com) and fill out our &quot;Cat Adoption Form.&quot;  An EHS representative will be pleased to help. <br />\n\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/b688d929-0b20-4c5e-8b88-a10df3d5a234/image/0a5ed7ea-d89f-455c-ba1b-f5c4cb3b3408.jpeg?versionId=3gE23g4fjzQsHnHet7gAYadR5VTGPo8a&amp;bust=1715114869&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/genie-71502748/on/toronto/etobicoke-humane-society-on46/","traits":{"playful":4,"affectionate":5,"sociable":4,"independent":3,"adventurous":2}},"george-70840208.json":{"id":"george-70840208","characteristics":"Long","name":"george","desc":"George is  a two year old, male, Persian mix.

Our adoption radius is generally approximately 100 km from Toronto.

They were trying to kill him. The lady who witnessed this pulled the kids away, immediately grabbed Hummer and took him home. She contacted a rescue group who agreed to take him.<br />\n<br />\nWhen he arrived at the foster, he was starving and scared. The foster noticed right away that he was jerky in his movements. It was concluded that this was the result of the beating.  <br />\n<br />\nAs time has passed and as Hummer has moved into adulthood, the jerkiness has subsided for the most part. It still shows up, mildly, especially when he is excited or happy to interact and chat with you.  <br />\n<br />\nIt was also discovered that he is deaf.  For this reason, it is best to approach him from the front so he can see you and know you are coming towards him.  <br />\n<br />\nThis also helps to give Hummer a point of focus which stops any jerkiness.  When he is focused, like chasing a ball for example or when he is relaxed on your lap, the jerkiness is completely gone. <br />\n<br />\nOther than the jerkiness and the deafness, Hummer is 100% healthy. There are no long term issues as a result of his past trauma.<br />\n<br />\nHummer has put his past life exactly where it belongs; in the past.  He is so ready for a home that is as special as he is.<br />\n<br />\nPERSONALITY: Named for the purr machine that he is, Hummer’s foster Mom says he is, “the most happy, content and delightful little guy. He is truly special.”<br />\nThough he is a little cautious at first, once he knows he is safe with you, he will shower you with affection and be the most devoted lap cat. He loves to sit on your chest and snuggle up to your neck for kisses and hugs.<br />\n<br />\nThis handsome lad simply adores humans. Nothing excites him more than being with his human. Hummer is only too happy to engage his human in play, chat or just hanging out watching Netflix together.<br />\n<br />\nHummer loves batting at the ball in the circle toy (as you can see in the video). This athletic hunk also loves climbing up the cat tree. Strong and still having kitten energy (typical of a Mau), Hummer can go from 0 to 100 in a flash. :)<br />\nWhen he is in relax mode, he enjoys looking out at the birds and squirrels checking out the latest episode of Nature TV.<br />\n<br />\nHummer is fine with children 10+ as long as they are calm and respectful (i.e. no pulling his tail or picking him up against his will) and mature enough to be sensitive and aware to Hummer’s being deaf.<br />\n<br />\nHe is also fine with other cats but doesn’t really interact with them. Humans are his jam. :)<br />\n<br />\nIDEAL HOME ENVIRONMENT: The sweet Soul is best suited to a calm, quiet and stable home where he can give and get love from his human and never have to fear being harmed again.<br />\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />\n<br />\nPlease email us at ask@alicesONEderland.com to request an adoption application for Happy Go HUMMER.

With his dark and alluring appearance, Hershey effortlessly charms all who lay eyes on him. But there’s more to this enchanting cat than meets the eye. Rescued as a stray from Hamilton, Hershey has embarked on a transformational journey that brought him to EHS, where he eagerly awaits that special someone or family who can provide him with a forever home filled with joy and warmth.<br />\n<br />\nHershey is the epitome of gentleness and tranquility. Though he was initially timid and reserved, time has allowed his true personality to shine through. Now, Hershey is a sweet and affectionate cat, who thrives on human attention. He has developed a fondness for belly rubs and head kisses, often greeting you with a flop to show his trust. His morning routine includes revelling in back scratches, loud purrs, and displaying his belly for some affection. Hershey loves to be by your side, observing your every move with interest, and he will patiently wait outside the door for you.<br />\n<br />\n Hershey has a knack for relaxation and can often be found lounging around, embracing his inner couch potato. His current favourite spot is by the window, where he can indulge in his love for watching birds and cars. Basking in the sunlight streaming through the window, Hershey takes pleasure in grooming himself. But don’t let his laid-back nature fool you! Hershey loves exploring and experiencing new things, eager to broaden his horizons. This chatty kitty has found his voice, particularly during mealtimes when he enjoys being petted and engaging in lively conversations with his human companions. His kittenish side shines through during playtime, when he delights in being vocal while he stalks, chases, and plays hide-and-seek with his best bud Thomas. He also really enjoys playing with the feather wand.<br />\n<br />\n Hershey has FIV, which is a virus that weakens the immune system of a cat. It is not transmissible to humans or other species. Cats who have FIV can live just as long as other cats if they are properly cared for with a good diet, indoor home, loving family, and vet checkups twice a year. Hershey does not require medication, but he would love to find a home to share with his best friend Thomas! A patient person with a calm, quiet home, without small children, would suit him well.<br />\n<br />\n With his endearing charm and playful spirit, Hershey is sure to bring joy and warmth to any home. Will you embrace the love and companionship of this delightful feline friend? If so, apply to adopt him and Thomas today!<br />\n --------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home a feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200.

But even at her shiest, I could see that she had a very intense interest on humans. Her beautiful blue eyes would follow me around all the time and just to see what I was up to. But when I looked at her, she would run away! After a couple of months of intense love, play and trust building activities, she has become incredibly friendly and a very loving companion. Even thought it takes her a little bit to get used to new people.<br />\n<br />\nBecause of this, I think Hoshi would be better suited to a home without dogs or other cats (apart from her sister Tsuki), or young children.<br />\n<br />\nShe ADORES her feather toy DaBird. She likes to jump so hard and so high, she almost looks like a salmon jumping!! And her favourite treats are the wet tube kind, like churu.<br />\n<br />\nSomething that is super adorable about Hoshi, is that she connects with you by voice. If you talk to her very nicely, she will not only listen, but talk back at you! And her noises are utterly adorable. She purrs, chirps like a bird, and sometimes goes around the house talking to herself in her super sweet, high pitch tiny little voice.<br />\n<br />\nHoshi LOVES her sister Tsuki, who is always bugging her to play more and more and to go explore the apartment. <br />\n<br />\nThey really are Ying and Yang.

Everyone feels loved when Jadoe is around!<br />\n<br />\nJadoe spent his first few years as a colony cat, but he&#039;s not much of a fighter. He is quite patient and tolerant even during things he dislikes, such as being brushed, being kept away from the other cats&#039; food, or spending time home alone. <br />\n<br />\nJadoe needs a home with a big, friendly family who&#039;ll love to play, sit, and sleep together with him. You&#039;d never know it from his happy demeanour, but Jadoe has mild irritable bowel disease (IBD). It is well-controlled with his current diet, and his forever family must be able to commit to prescription veterinary food, daily probiotics, and regular exercise. His thick fur also requires regular brushing with the furminator. With the right food and care, cats with IBD can live very long and healthy lives—and a loving companion like Jadoe is totally worth the effort!<br />\n<br />\nLike all ACR cats, Jadoe has been treated for fleas and parasites. Jadoe is negative for FIV and FeLV.\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/dda862df-be19-421b-aac8-f113b69af693/image/d70cc633-bca8-486e-af00-6bbc81732433.jpg?versionId=EHwL1PCqS2jSVG5nvX_iRF4Jd.p37TtL&amp;bust=1720047581&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/jadoe-65773482/on/toronto/annex-cat-rescue-on115/","traits":{"playful":4,"affectionate":5,"sociable":4,"independent":2,"adventurous":3}},"jasmine-71869484.json":{"id":"jasmine-71869484","characteristics":"Affectionate, Athletic, Gentle, Calm, Silly","name":"jasmine","desc":"Jasmine and Anna had a home for 3 years.

Jasmine is athletic, loving, gentle and calm. She is very protective and dominant. She enjoys looking out the window, playing fetch with her favourite crinkle balls and cuddling with her sister Anna. Anna is playful, active, loving and silly. She likes sleeping under blankets, playing with her crinkle balls and wand toys, receiving scratches on her back and all over her face.

Please complete our online application found at: avacats.org/adopt/adoption-form. Our adoption fees cover vetting and include spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccines (initial FVRCP and rabies), flea treatment, two dewormings and microchipping. Kittens up to a year old: Adoption fees are $275 for each kitten up to 12 months old. Please note that fees may apply for additional required vaccinations (at $75 per booster) due prior to adoption. Total adoption fees will be confirmed by the AVA Adoption Coordinator. Adults one year or older: Adoption fees are $250 for each adult cat 1 year or older. Please note that fees may apply for additional required vaccinations (at $75 per booster) due prior to adoption. Total adoption fees will be confirmed by the AVA Adoption Coordinator. All AVA kittens 12 months or younger must be adopted in pairs or go to a home with another young cat (3 years or younger). Kittens learn from each other how to behave, which helps them turn into well-adjusted adult cats.

She loves playtime and meows excitedly when the toy drawer opens! Jill is content to hang out on a perch looking out the window or sleep on a chair next to you. She often comes by for head rubs, and will sit in your lap for treats. Each night Jill tucks herself into bed, and in the morning politely waits or plays until the humans get up. <br />\n<br />\nInitially shy, Jill thrives in a predictable environment with a routine. Also curious, she enjoys inspecting new things and trying new toys. Jill is used to having guests over; she will sit in her cubby and observe until she is ready to come out and say hello. Playtime’s the #1 way to build Jill’s confidence in new environments. Though she has a cubby where she goes if she gets spooked, encouragement or a treat often draws her out. Jill needs an experienced person willing to help expand her comfort zone. She may not be suited to small children or other pets, though we haven’t observed her with a companion cat. <br />\n<br />\nDue to immune issues, Jill had all her teeth removed and is on liquid medicine that gets mixed into her wet food. Jill still loves kibble though, and tube treats! Jill’s cute habit of saying ‘thanks’ with a head bump before tucking in to her meal will melt your heart.<br />\n<br />\nJill has shown wonderful improvements in carrier training, and her foster is still working on getting her more comfortable with being picked up. Jill has impeccable litter box habits and is good about using her scratcher.  <br />\n<br />\nDue to chronic inflammation issues, Jill has had all her teeth removed and is prone to skin irritation. She is on a once-daily liquid medication to manage these issues.<br />\nLike all ACR cats, Jill has been treated for fleas and parasites.

For the first few weeks Jill was very scared, but she has since come out of her shell and blossomed with her fosters’ patient handling and accommodations. She will need an understanding and experienced family to help cement her trust in people as she is still learning to lower her guards. It’s a challenge for her to overcome certain ingrained aversions that was part of her formative life spent in a colony. Time, patience, and a lot of love for this brave tabby girl will reap eventual rewards of a cat finally secure in the safety of a home and loving kindness of her people. She will be a joy to all around once she acclimates to a new space. <br />\n<br />\nA good way to break the ice with her is by playing. Jill LOVES to play and will chase a laser dot for hours! She also likes the wand toy as well. This is a great way to get Jill comfortable with her surroundings, and bonding with the people near her. She is a small, dainty cat who enjoys food, but only eats small portions at a time, a perfectly normal and healthy cat feeding behaviour. She enjoys Churu treats in a bowl, not directly from your hand, just another endearing quirk that’s quintessentially Jill.<br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes to pettings, Jill prefers her head and chin scratched. She may keep her distance in the beginning and not allow pets right away, but once trust is established, she lets you know closer contact is desired when she starts to rub her head and body on the furniture while you are in the room with her. Those are Jill’s signals that she is ready for some serious affection! Jill’s favourite lounge spots are on a cat couch or on a cat tree. She sometimes lets out a little chirp as a greeting when you enter the room, yet another Jill specialty. <br />\n<br />\nAlthough Jill does not like sudden movements or loud noises, she recovers quickly once those stimuli are removed. It’s still a challenge for her to be picked up or handled, as her fear has not entirely subsided about what comes after being picked up. Patience and understanding will play big roles in convincing her no harm will come to her as a consequence, and time of course, is the great pacifier.<br />\n<br />\nSince day 1 Jill has been great about using the litter box, a proper little lady that she is! Jill needs her good friend Jack who she adores, just watch the awww-inspiring video evidence! The two have formed a close friendship that offers comfort and companionship for both. Jack’s chill vibes really calm Jill’s skittish tendencies, and the two pals will make a complete package for a family ready to offer them the world.<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Jill and buddy Jack too, a part of your family?

Jonas is very athletic and has the best time running around the house. He doesn’t mind if you pick him up, but he doesn’t have time to stay and cuddle on your lap - he’s got to go run and play! Speaking of playing, Jonas hasn’t met a toy he didn’t like. But, if forced to choose, he is going with string toys. The water bowl is also fun to play in! Jonas enjoys lounging in the sun, fully stretched out, belly up! Jonas will often come when called and roll around on the floor, looking for attention. A good eater, Jonas isn’t fussy about food, especially wet food. Jonas can be a bully to other cats, so for this reason, he must be the only cat in your home. We are unsure how he is with kids or dogs. <br />\n<br />\nJonas was living the farm life before he came to us. Volunteers went to pick up another cat on the property and discovered him living outside with his siblings. He immediately responded to pets and scratches, so knowing he was too friendly to be outside, he came to the rescue to find his forever home at last. <br />\n<br />\nJonas will be the perfect addition to a home looking for an active cat that loves to run and play.

Some of her shelter neighbours should take notes! Kiara loves to spend time around people she trusts, sleeping with her former family members and soaking up attention (she&#039;s a giant fan of brushes!). Kiara was surrendered to us as her family was moving out of the country, and there was nobody else able to take her in. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Kiara can take some time to warm up to people, she&#039;s definitely worth the investment! She loves people and even seemed to accept kids into the family, a difficult task for many cats. When she&#039;s not around people, Kiara loves to find boxes to move into, using her imagination to create her dream Barbie homes (with her being the main character, of course!). The more packages her adopter receives, the better. As she hasn&#039;t had any interactions with other cats, she&#039;d likely do best in a single animal home. <br />\n<br />\nDo you have a home (and some boxes) to make Kiara&#039;s dream come true? If so, fill out an application today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300.

A kind employee brought them to our sister rescue For Love of Ferals. The timing was propitious as Kiko had a degloved jaw and surgery had to be done quickly. He has recovered completely from the ordeal and is now handsome as ever, eager to start the next leg of his adventure with brother Kyo in their new forever home!<br />\n<br />\nKiko can be distinguished from his brother Kyo by the white streak down the centre of his back just above the tail. Kiko’s fur is also more of a striped, slightly muted marmalade hue than Kyo’s darker orange, marbled markings. The boys are inseparable and do everything together, from playing to grooming to cuddling. Kiko is a little timid with new people and situations, but quickly adapts, and then his confidence shines brightly. Kiko adores playing with any flying wand toys, and will range wide and jump high to snatch it out of the air! His curiosity knows no bound, and any new toys or spaces must be examined thoroughly for play/snuggle potential. <br />\n<br />\nKiko is energetic and brother Kyo provides the perfect playmate for an active routine. Daytime play sessions are highly recommended to help expend all that playful energy, so all can settle down for a restful night of cuddles and sleep. Kiko loves to be petted and stroked, and will fall asleep in arms or laps while purring happily. He has great litter habits and excellent appetite.<br />\n<br />\nKiko and Kyo are two orange peas in a pod just perfect to add colour, fun and lots of love to a family. They are open to make friends with other social cats, but have not met dogs or children in their foster home.

From the very first interaction, Lainey walked up to her without any hesitation and rubbed against her leg. After seeing Lainey a couple more times, the volunteer became convinced that she didn’t have a home. She knocked on doors and spoke with neighbours, finding out that Lainey belonged to no one. She was being fed by a couple of kind-hearted people who believed Lainey had been left behind when her family moved. Given how friendly and sweet she is, it’s easy to believe she was once a beloved family pet who enjoyed being affectionate with the people in her life. It’s a testament to Lainey’s resilience that she continues to be the friendly girl she is, despite having been abandoned and living outdoors for several years.<br />\n<br />\nLainey was taken in by AVA and quickly adapted to being indoors, luxuriating in all the comforts she deserves, including a warm place to sleep, food, water, and someone to love her. During her initial visit to the veterinarian, it was discovered that Lainey has hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), which explained her small size of just 7 lbs. Lainey immediately began medical treatment, which consists of a pill twice a day. She will require this medication for life. After a few months on this medication, Lainey’s thyroid levels have returned to normal.<br />\n<br />\nLainey is a sweet and beautiful girl who is curious to explore her surroundings but also wants to remain close to people. She’s friendly with everyone she meets and loves to spend time snuggled beside or in her rescuer’s lap. She enjoys having her ears and chin scratched and her body stroked. You can easily pick her up and give her kisses on her head, as she loves to be held in your arms and will nestle her head cozily into your elbow or shoulder, enjoying the warmth and comfort of being close to you.<br />\n<br />\nShe is learning how to play and will bat around small mice and balls, but her favourite toy is anything that’s got to do with her human. She enjoys lounging in her bed or on a soft towel on a chair, and sleeping on the bed with her rescuer. Lainey is most interested in being with people and has not shown the same affection for other cats, so she would likely be happiest as the only pet in the home. She enjoys eating both wet and dry food, as well as her Friskies treats, and has excellent litter box habits.<br />\n<br />\nLainey is a special girl with a lovely personality. One look into those big, beautiful eyes, and you will be smitten.

A king among cats! <br />\n<br />\nThe name Leroy derives from the French “Le Roi” or “The King” and this handsome, ginger boy certainly carries himself like royalty. <br />\n<br />\nLeroy sought refuge at EHS after being bullied by his brother. (The “spare” to his “heir” perhaps? Check back for the bestselling memoir!) Whatever the story, it’s clear Leroy needs a new forever palace with a court who will allow him to live like the king he is. <br />\n<br />\nCurrently in a loving foster home, Leroy loves having his gorgeous ginger coat brushed and will always show up for a play session with feathers and balls. Who needs a jester when these fun toys are available? <br />\n<br />\nLeroy is a cat who seems to have a lot on his mind, enjoying long sessions relaxing in contemplation. Don’t leave him alone for too long though, as this king needs companionship. Leroy’s foster parents report that he gets along well with dogs and other cats, and he actively seeks out affection from humans. Leroy has never been exposed to small children, so a home without wee subjects would be best. <br />\n<br />\nCould Leroy be the king of your castle? Why not schedule a meeting today and find out? You both might be in for the royal treatment! <br />\n-------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...or, double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. <br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Leroy?

She did a great job caring for all 4 of them and made sure they learned how to cat; and once they were ready they all found their furever homes leaving momma behind to learn about the joys of indoor life without kids. <br />\n<br />\nBut it wasn’t too long before another litter of kittens arrived in the foster room. These babies didn’t have a momma with them, and we weren’t sure how momma Lily would feel about the additional duty; but to our pleasant surprise she accepted them and cared for them like they were her own. She cleaned them and helped break up their fights, hissed when they were bad and trilled when they were good, she led them through the ins and outs of being a cat. This group went on to find their homes as well. This repeated a couple more times. Each time momma Lily being a great model for the young ones. What we have learned through many groups of foster kitties being under Lily&#039;s care is that she is a &quot;cat&#039;s cat:&quot; Lily is much happier being around multiple felines and much prefers them to humans. She is what we call a Shadow Cat. Lily will live in the shadows during the day and avoid you if she can, and when the humans are away, she will come out to play and interact with the other cats. <br />\n<br />\nLily loves to play with the other fosters cats, or gaze down on them from a perch up above or a cubby near the sun, she enjoys sunbathing by the widow too! She will chirp and trill while playing with ball and mouse catnip toys with the other cats and she loves her dry food and Temptations cat treats. She is every cat’s friend. It’s just humans who are not at the top of the list of Lily’s favourite things!<br />\n<br />\nShe does have a spicy side, and can let loose a mighty hiss and a stern paw to show you that you’re getting too close too fast. She gives plenty of warnings first, however. She prefers a slow and quiet approach for pets and chin scratches for the humans who are willing to keep investing time to see if she will learn to love us eventually too. Slow and steady wins your way into Lily’s heart. If you have a cat - or several cats - longing for feline companionship, Lily would be a great cat for them. Because our pets need pets too! <br />\n<br />\nLily is about 4.5 yeas old.<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Lily a part of your family?

She isn’t afraid to ask for what she wants, which happens to be a good dose of affection.

Chasing string toys, rolling in catnip, and being brushed also rank high on Lumi’s list of preferred activities. Ever curious, she likes to explore her surroundings (closets in particular). Lumi also loves watching cat videos on YouTube, either by herself or cuddling with her foster mom before going to sleep.<br />\n <br />\nLumi is unquestionably a people’s cat and would do best as the only cat in the household.

During her time with us, we&#039;ve learned that Lumi is capable of impeccable litter box habits if she has access to at least two litter boxes and is not confined to any rooms.

Churu or Catit tube treats are her favorites! Even after waking up from a nap, she starts to chat, perhaps making sure she&#039;s not alone. As lovely and unique as Marley is, she values her independence. While she&#039;s not aggressive, she isn&#039;t quick to accept affection. You can give her gentle pets if you move slowly, but when awake, she prefers to maintain her distance. Initially, she may seek hiding spots as change can be unsettling, but once she feels at ease in her new environment, she&#039;ll confidently explore and lounge in the coziest corners.

This lovable kitty found his way to EHS after facing some challenges in his previous home. But don’t worry, Meeko is ready to start a new chapter filled with love and understanding, as he patiently waits for that special someone or family to take him to his forever home.<br />\n<br />\nMeeko is a sociable and tender cat. A true sweetheart, this little guy craves attention and affection, making him the perfect companion for someone who can shower him with love and playtime. Despite his spirited nature and constant need for entertainment, Meeko is a cuddle bug at heart. He adores being petted, sitting on laps, and perching on his humans&#039; shoulders like a little parrot. <br />\n <br />\nCurious by nature, Meeko can often be found investigating closed doors and cupboards, eager to discover what lies behind them. Playing with his favourite mouse toy is one of Meeko&#039;s most cherished pastimes, and he has a quirky habit of sneaking into the bathtub to catch water droplets from the tap. You&#039;ll want to keep a close eye on him, though, because Meeko can be a little rascal when it comes to plastic, as he especially enjoys tearing open plastic bags and tape. He doesn&#039;t consume them, but it&#039;s best to watch him to be safe. We&#039;ve also learned that Meeko has a newfound passion for bird watching as the weather heats up. This inquisitive feline gets exhilarated by the fluttering birds that visit his balcony, where he avidly perches to observe them through the glass door. As he watches intently, Meeko can’t help but emit strange yet endearing sounds, adding to his charm. Mesmerised by his feathery friends, he remains stationed at the glass door until the birds eventually take their leave, leaving Meeko eagerly anticipating their next visit.<br />\n<br />\nEven though Meeko has a hearty appetite and eagerly anticipates mealtime, he is following a special diet. Meeko doesn’t get along with other cats, and we are not certain how well he will do in a household with dogs or small children. However, if you’re looking for a furry friend who&#039;s a delightful and well-behaved companion (and who will keep you on your toes from time to time!), Meeko is the purr-fect match for you! As for his purr-fect match, we highly recommend someone with a vet reference in their name and who has lots of time they can devote to interacting with him, so he doesn&#039;t get into any mischief if he gets bored or is left alone for too long. With his friendly demeanor and love for meeting new people, Meeko is sure to bring joy and laughter into your home.<br />\n<br />\nLet this playful ball of fur steal your heart! Apply to adopt Meeko, and he promises to be by your side through thick and thin!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home a feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200. Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Meeko?

This stunning girl with big amber eyes is still wary of people, but she gets braver every day! Its impossible to know what kinds of experiences she had with humans in the past, but she tends to be much less nervous around new cats than she is around new people. In her foster home, Meela has started to claim more space outside of her bedroom, and explore the cat shelves in the living room. She lives with multiple people, but has especially bonded with her roommate. She has even started to cuddle up with her in bed, and will mew inquisitively at her when its time for dinner but food is nowhere to be found! She is slowly warming up to the other people in the household too, as she can sometimes be found watching them cook from the entryway to the kitchen. Meela enjoys observing everything around her, and although she doesnt seek pets or physical affection, she still loves to be a part of the action! And she&#039;ll even sometimes let her roommate gently brush her.<br />\n<br />\nMeela has lots of play energy, and one of her favourite things is to run through her tunnel and bat toys around overnight! Sometimes, she even pounces at her roommates feet! Play is another method her future adopter can use to bond with her. Meela is a fan of Temptations, but refuses to eat Blue Wilderness cat treats - picky kitty! Meela would fit in wonderfully in a multi-cat household, where she can follow the lead of more confident cats. This girl has so much love to give, but needs a patient adopter who understands that she requires time to overcome her past and journey to Canada.

After coming into AVA care in 2021, a wonderful family was found to adopt him. Unfortunately they have developed severe allergies that, while they have tried many options to try and manage, make it impossible for them to continue to live with Melvin. We now hope to find Melvin his third and final home! <br />\n<br />\nMelvin (aka Meelo) is the sweetest cat and loves belly rubs, attention and definitely not being alone! He is needy for human attention and also needs a friendly and gentle/chill feline (or two) in his forever home. He gets lonely (and very vocal!) without other cats around, and would calmly accept other cats hissing at him just to have a fur friend around. He is a friendly boy who may be a little shy in new surroundings, but with some comfort to let him know he is safe, he will quickly warm up and love all your belly rubs! He is a very lovable cat and purrs even when you look at him - he will thrive in a home where he can be pet and pampered and will make biscuits on you once he trusts you. Melvin is so trusting that he will let you brush his teeth. <br />\n<br />\nAs a classic ginger kitty, Melvin loves playing with wand toys and laser pointers, and has even learned to give paws for treats! His curiosity cannot be contained, and his smarts meant cupboard doors can be breached to access those treats! Watch out for this smart cookie and his adorable antics!<br />\n<br />\nMelvin loves his cardboard scratch post.<br />\n<br />\nHe is on a new diet of urinary food to help with a partial urinary blockage with some crystals that were shown in urinary analysis. Has not had issues since adjusting to his diet of lots of wet food supplemented with water — which is great for any cat&#039;s overall health but extra important for our male kitties. He&#039;s not the best at eating wet food and prefers it to be on the soupy side so he can lick it up (add water to wet food, mush it with a spoon and choose more mousse-types of food). While he is stable on his diet and regimen, he should be carefully monitored for any urinary issues. <br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Melvin a part of your family?

He would fit in well anywhere.<br />\n<br />\nAs he was previously let outside, Mighty was hit by a car many years ago and lost his tail as a result.

Millie is patiently waiting for that special someone or family to take her to a loving home where she can continue to blossom and thrive.<br />\n<br />\nMillie may be a bit shy at first, but she’s not one to completely hide away forever. Her true personality shines when she’s in the presence of another friendly feline. Millie is a social butterfly when it comes to other cats, finding comfort and companionship in their presence. She’s known to come out of her hiding spot when another cat is around, showing her trust and willingness to connect. Millie has made incredible strides in her journey towards trust and accept human affection, and now she eagerly welcomes pets and scratches from people. Previously prone to growling and weary of the human touch, she now happily sniffs your hands before allowing gentle strokes on her head, chin, and neck, purring contently as she enjoys the attention. She occasionally will be caught making biscuits, which is a delightful display of her comfort and happiness, showcasing her newfound sense of security and relaxation around humans. Millie has a soft spot for the back-scratcher, which always elicits loud purrs that sound like a motor. These purrs not only show her contentment but also help soothe her nerves, making her feel safe and loved.<br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes to relaxation, Millie’s favourite pastime is curling up in her treasured spot – the bucket. Here, she can often be found snoozing peacefully. One thing that never fails to make Millie’s day is the irresistible taste of churu treats! These delectable treats are her absolute favourite, and she’ll eagerly indulge in them whenever they’re offered.<br />\n<br />\nMillie is a special cat with a unique personality. She does well with other cats, but we are not yet sure how she’ll do in a household with other pets or small children. However, with a little patience, love, care, and understanding, Millie will undoubtedly become a cherished member of any family who&#039;s lucky enough to call her their own.<br />\n<br />\nOpen your heart to Millie, give her the loving home she deserves, and witness the beauty of her transformation. Apply to adopt Millie today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home a feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200. Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Millie?

AVA does not accept applications for single kittens**<br />\n<br />\nMillie is the little sister at 8 months to Abbie’s year old wise older sibling. Although not related, they have found each other in foster and are now best friends for life. Sometimes it’s hard to tell where one starts and the other ends, as the two are twined around each other while at rest, and can be found within touching distance wherever they may be. Fortunately, Millie is a lovely tortoiseshell and Abbie a dilute torbie, you can tell them apart by their colours, otherwise, you’d be playing a daily game of “Where does one end and the other begin?”!<br />\n<br />\nBeing a youngster, Millie is curious about everything and must check out every corner of the space and sniff everything. She is also obsessed with the laser dot, her focus on tracking it absolute, and the speed with which she follows the streaking dot is awe-inspiringly impressive! Daily sessions of hunt the dot and catch the flying wand toy are great ways to satisfy her prey drive and expend her inexhaustible store of energy.<br />\n<br />\nThese girls still require time, patience and continued human engagement to be entirely comfortable in any space. With a lot of love and food bribes, they will eventually be convinced that people are wonderful sources of affection and good food. Then they can securely settle down to be the best cat companions the family will ever know.<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Millie and Abbie a part of your family?

Please note that fees may apply for additional required vaccinations (at $75 per booster) due prior to adoption. Total adoption fees will be confirmed by the AVA Adoption Coordinator.<br />\n<br />\nAll AVA kittens 12 months or younger must be adopted in pairs or go to a home with another young cat (3 years or younger). Kittens learn from each other how to behave, which helps them turn into well-adjusted adult cats. In general, paired cats have happier and healthier lives because they have a constant companion and playmate.

She moves around her foster home and is comfortable lying in open areas where humans and the other cats are occupying.

Can’t really blame him because he couldn’t trust that he won’t be abandoned outside yet again, which was what happened when his previous family up and moved away.<br />\n<br />\nThankfully, he slowly came around after a few weeks of patient coaxing with love, food and treats. As he gained more trust, he sought out cuddles and head scratches, purring contentedly as he realizes human companionship is pretty much all positive. <br />\n<br />\nMorton loves to play, whether it’s chasing a ball or pouncing on a toy mouse. He has a playful nature, but can become defensive if feeling vulnerable for whatever reason. Usually docile and serene, he could flare up with a hiss if he feels scared or territorial, especially over the box that he loves to sleep in. Comfy blankets aren’t for him, yet, he prefers the box, so the box he gets! Although he is very gentle, he still has some boundaries; but over time as he settles into a secure, loving home, he will let go of them and be his truly amazing self.<br />\n  <br />\nInitially when Morton met the foster’s kitty, he was immediately smitten even though she was not impressed. But his persistent courting of her friendship wore her down quickly and now the two cuddle like an old, married couple! He will definitely need a social but not too dominant cat friend in his new home, and with the appropriate introduction intervals, be a best buddy for life. Morton will make a great pet with his gentle nature, playful spirit, and affectionate personality! Plus he is a handsome mini-lion with a majestic mane and tail, and big, expressive eyes, just the things to steal hearts!<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Morton a part of your family? Please complete our online application found at: avacats.org/adopt/adoption-form.<br />\n<br />\nOur adoption fees cover vetting and include spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccines (initial FVRCP and rabies), flea treatment, two dewormings and microchipping.<br />\n<br />\nAdoption fees are $250 for each adult cat 1 year or older. Please note that fees may apply for additional required vaccinations (at $75 per booster) due prior to adoption. Total adoption fees will be confirmed by the AVA Adoption Coordinator.\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/a806ea0f-1c46-4204-a6c1-e89e68b56840/image/659e8f44-2da2-482a-b9c0-9b45ae0fd115.jpeg?versionId=644q1VoBtcv5VcWbvISDAal_Aco0wnHP&amp;bust=1721269502&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/morton-71989388/on/toronto/action-volunteers-for-animals-toronto-west-on54/","traits":{"playful":4,"affectionate":4,"sociable":3,"independent":4,"adventurous":3}},"mushball-meshmesh-72297859.json":{"id":"mushball-meshmesh-72297859","characteristics":"Affectionate, Athletic, Friendly, Gentle, Independent, Loyal, Playful, Smart, Couch potato, Loves Kisses, Chatty, Super Loving, Loves Attention, Charmer","name":"mushball meshmesh","desc":"Name: Mushball Meshmesh<br />\nBreed: Ginger Spotted Egyptian Mau<br />\nColour: Ginger<br />\nGender: Male<br />\nAge: App. 3 ½  years<br />\nGood with cats: With easygoing cats who can match his energy and personality but would prefer to be on his own.<br />\nGood with cat-friendly dogs: Unknown<br />\nGood with kids: Yes<br />\n<br />\nNeutered, fully vaccinated, micro-chipped and treated for worms and fleas.<br />\n<br />\nPlease email us at ask@alicesONEderland.com to request an adoption application for Mushball Meshmesh.

Oliver has a unique meow, a delightful double chirp, which adds to his charm, along with his beautiful purr when receiving pets and attention.

At seven years old, she is the purr-fect companion for anyone looking to skip those pesky (and often overwhelming) kitten years. Peanut is a natural hunter, whether shes playing in her favourite expandable cat tube, chasing after wand toys, or perched up on the windowsill chattering at the birds and squirrels. She loves to play and would be the perfect fit in a single cat home, or with a playmate who enjoys hunting just as much as she does. She adores sleeping close to her human friends at night, and often snuggles with her work-from-home foster dad during the day. Funny enough, Peanut isnt a fan of cat trees, but she will bask in the sun on a chair for hours if you let her!<br />\n<br />\nPeanut was abandoned in a city park, in a dirty carrier reeking of cigarette smoke. After she found her way to Team Cat Rescue, our amazing team discovered she had urinary crystals and needed prescription food to help her remain healthy and happy. Since receiving the optimal food for her system, Peanut has thrived in her foster parents home! She quickly adapted to her new litter box and now conducts consistent healthy bathroom activities. And she LOVES her prescription food!<br />\n<br />\nPeanut enjoys exploring every nook and cranny of her new surroundings. Like most cats, it can take her a bit of time to warm up to you, but once you show her your love and care, she will request head pats and scratches often! As a bonus, Peanut never wakes up her human friends for food, but rather waits patiently for her morning kibbles (what a polite lady!). Peanut would do best with adults or older children who can read her cues. She has not been tested with dogs. Give Peanut the chance to blossom in your home and you will become friends fur-ever!

The boys proved their assessment correct, and thrived in foster care learning to live comfortably indoors with people. Now graduated with gold stars on their report card, they seek to join a home ready to provide shelter, food and love to these handsome cats.<br />\n<br />\nMemories of colony life may be fading, but Pepper still retains instinctive reactions to loud noises and sudden motions. Although he startles easily, he is also quick to relax once he realizes there is no threat and he is safe. By nature, he is a very friendly, inquisitive and energetic cat in the prime of his life, always ready to purr, loves attention, and spurred by a few cheek scratches, happily rolling on the floor for more pets. Pepper loves to play, his favourite games are lurking in a tunnel ready to pounce, chasing the end of a wand hidden under a blanket, and binge watching cat TV. He is great with other cats and loves playing, grooming and cuddling with them. <br />\n<br />\nPepper is an entertaining and delightful cat, clean and with excellent litter box habits. This sweet, shy and silly boy is hoping to go home with some of his new friends at the adoption centre, but he is also fine befriending another young, social and playful cat who wants to be his best buddy.

He simply cannot imagine a better place for his loyal admirers to appreciate his beauty as he stretches and grooms himself.<br />\n<br />\nA precocious lad, Pip has already learned good kitty manners from his mama. He has a blast taking out his scratching urges on cat trees and scratching posts, and he’s neat and tidy in the litter box. So, he hopes you’ll find it in your heart to forgive him if he sees your shoelaces and wants to play with them sometimes! <br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of play, Pip would really love it if you spent lots of time with him! High places are great and all, but nothing beats your lap, chest, shoulders, or anywhere else he can snuggle up against. He can’t wait for you to come home and decompress with him for as long as you want.<br />\n<br />\nPlease note: kittens, like Pip, have lots of energy!!! They require ample and mindful stimulation, through play, from their humans. Their optimal development also benefits tremendously from having a four-legged companion in the home to socialize with. So, we would prefer that Pip go to a home where there is already a feline-friendly cat or dog in residence or be adopted with another compatible shelter animal.<br />\n<br />\nAre you ready to say pip-pip to your boring old life sans Pip and welcome him into your home?

Well, Prancer the green-eyed feline has plenty to tell you! EHS took in around 20 cats from a garage in 2019, and Prancer was later found living inside the main home. We don&#039;t know how long she was in the home for, but she didn&#039;t seem to have had much positive interaction with people in the household. Prancer is now beginning to get more comfortable around people on her own terms.<br />\n <br />\nShe loves to play--whether it&#039;s by herself or with a human controlling a wand, she&#039;ll give it her all to catch those elusive little toys. Or, if she&#039;s feeling particularly energetic, she&#039;ll show off her stellar soccer moves by batting a ball around the room. Even with complete strangers, Prancer will allow people to get close to her, as long as they don&#039;t try to touch her. With people she knows (along especially if they have a treat to offer), Prancer has started to accept pets by hand.<br />\n<br />\nPrancer has recently moved to a foster home from the shelter, and has enjoyed the opportunity to explore her temporary home. During her time at the shelter, she spent most of her day up on shelves, occasionally coming down to play. In her foster home, she loves to test out new pieces of furniture, but has her few favourite spots to sleep in (she&#039;s a big fan of &quot;her&quot; couch!). Prancer would prefer to be the only cat in the household. <br />\n<br />\nPrancer is a skittish cat who has had minimal experience with humans. With the help of a foster family, she is on a journey to adapt to a new environment and become more comfortable around people. Potential adopters should be prepared to commit the time, effort, and patience required to build Prancer’s confidence and trust. It should be noted that while some skittish cats might remain reserved, others may express their trust and affection in a variety of ways. A skittish cat will benefit from a calm, quiet environment, preferably without small children. If needed, EHS will offer post-adoption support to assist Prancer with a successful transition to her forever home.<br />\n<br />\nDo you need a cat for your sleigh--sorry--home? Prancer can guide you to the adoption application tonight!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Prancer?

While her past remains a mystery, this exquisite feline is currently in foster care, eagerly awaiting the perfect match to whisk her away to her forever home.<br />\n<br />\nReese is not only beautiful, but she is also incredibly friendly. She possesses a sweet and independent nature, showcasing a unique blend of aloofness balanced with a deep desire to keep you company. Reese loves her comfort and can often be found lounging in her favourite spots, whether it&#039;s her anti-anxiety bed, a dinning room chair, or the welcome mat in front of the door. She also delights in the simple pleasures of sitting beside you on the couch or bed as you unwind in front of the TV. Curiosity is one of Reese&#039;s defining traits. She is always investigating her surroundings, leaving no corner unexplored. You can often find her rolling on the floor, reveling in the joy of her discoveries. Reese is also very food motivated and is always on the hunt for her next meal, emitting a charming squawk when she is ready to be fed. She adores affection and revels in pets and scratches, particularly on her cheeks, chin, neck, and yes, even her butt! She isn’t shy about asking for attention, often rubbing against your feet to signal her desire for more pets. Being brushed is another of Reese’s favourite pastimes, especially under her chin and along the top of her head, which elicits soft purrs of contentment. When it comes to playtime, Reese is a fan of interactive wand toys that challenge both her agility and intellect. Although calm and sociable appears to be Reese&#039;s baseline temperament, her foster family has found that, on occasion, she adopts a rather spicy disposition, and a hiss or swat will let you know that she doesn&#039;t want to interact. These moods seem to be rare, but it&#039;s important to read her body language and let Reese tell you how she&#039;s feeling.<br />\n<br />\nReese navigates the world with grace and sets clear boundaries, making her an ideal companion for anyone who respects her wishes, including children. Reese will thrive in a quiet home environment and will flourish under the care of an experienced cat owner who understands her unique personality and needs. With her gentle demeanor, love of companionship, and playful spirit, Reese can be more than just a cat—she can be a beloved member of the family, just waiting to bring joy and warmth into your home.<br />\n<br />\nAre you willing to open your heart and home to this lovely tabby cat?

An experienced cat parent who has the patience and know-how in rehabilitating cats who need space and love is ideal for Roxy to thrive and blossom.

A true socialite, he effortlessly charms everyone he meets, hoping to find his forever home where he can use his social skills to the fullest! <br />\n<br />\nThis loving, fluffy man was recently returned to our care, through no fault on his part. Ever adaptable, Rufus is putting himself back out there! His warm spirit and affectionate nature shine, sprouting with the spring sun and breeze. Purring is second nature to this lovely boy, a constant soundtrack to his joyful presence. He loves getting attention from anyone, and if you call, he will come running, hoping to get a nice body rub. Anywhere will do, as long as he gets a massage! When he feels the need for extra love, Rufus isn&#039;t shy about crying or pawing at your feet and body, and you can usually expect a head bonk when he&#039;s looking for pets. He is more than willing to let you pick him up, with the expectation of pets or food. This fluffy man isn&#039;t afraid of being assertive when he wants something. <br />\n<br />\nRufus has a very curious soul, having tried to eat human food. He&#039;s even taken a liking to watching golf on tv, pawing at the ball to catch it. With his high energy levels, he needs toys to tire him out before bed; otherwise, this energy-packed furball will have zoomies around the house. Rufus enjoys playing with the wand and string toys, and his foster family have used Rufus&#039;s playtime as a workout. This playful machine will lead people by pulling the wand toy when wanting to play in a different room. It&#039;s safe to say he knows what he wants!<br />\n<br />\nDo you like to cuddle at night? Rufus is known for finding his way into his foster parents&#039; bed to snuggle up and get warm. He loves to stay near people and will require a forever family that can be attentive, accept his clingy nature, and is experienced with cat behaviour. Rufus&#039; love of people and play can lead to overstimulation so his forever family should be able to read his body language to prevent any nipping or swatting. Rufus is learning that the best place to scratch is a scratching post and his new family should continue to encourage this behaviour.  His ideal home is one filled with love, patience, cozy sleeping spots, and lots of food. <br />\n<br />\nAre you looking for the ultimate snuggle buddy? Rufus is ready to occupy that position. Fill out an adoption application today!<br />\n --------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...Or double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Rufus?

And just like that, Scooby and Shaggy appeared at the front door of our shelter from parts unknown. While waiting to meet his new forever family, Scooby loves to hang out with his buddy Shaggy, often chatting away while watching the goings on around him. This boy certainly has plenty to say!<br />\n<br />\nConsidering the fact that his previous life seems to have been less than kind to this handsome black boy, he has a sweet, shy demeanour and simply wants to be loved. Volunteers describe Scooby as a gentle boy. He&#039;s curious, and is becoming less hesitant when receiving pets with the back-scratcher and even by hand. Scooby accepts touch on his head and the back of his neck, and will stand up and slowly move away when he has had enough. Volunteers report that he was recently enjoying a petting session so much that he even leaned in and closed his eyes. He eventually put his head down to sleep and rolled to show his belly! Way to go Scooby! Did someone say &quot;Scooby Snacks?&quot; Dry food seems to be his &quot;snack&quot; of choice, though he also enjoys tube treats when left to relish this delicacy on his own. <br />\n<br />\nScooby would like you to know that he wants to spend the rest of his life with his long-time best friend Shaggy, so they will need to be welcomed as a pair. He does enjoy a good romp with his brother, and can also be seen cuddling with him. Might they be discussing their next adventure? Scooby&#039;s detective days might well be over, but it seems fair to assume that he will enjoy exploring his new surroundings in a calm household given his reserved nature. As for companions other than humans and Shaggy, he would be willing to share his forever home with a compatible feline. Like his early years, his previous contact with dogs remains a mystery, so despite his namesake, we can&#039;t speculate on how he feels about them.<br />\n<br />\nHe&#039;s here just waiting for you!

He quickly trained her on a routine that involves second breakfast, evening playtime with toys, and a pre-sleep cuddle.<br />\n<br />\nShadow&#039;s idea of cuddling is squashing beside you, burrowing his head into your arm, or sleeping with you. While he&#039;s not a lap cat, he&#039;s filled with purrs when you pet him, particularly on his head. He&#039;s also highly huggable. His foster mom loves picking him up!<br />\n<br />\nShadow will nip gently or swat when he&#039;s had enough (and hard if keep bugging him). He will do best in a home that&#039;s had cats before and understands how they communicate their boundaries.<br />\n<br />\nShadow is slightly overweight. To help his activity, he really needs interactive playtime (he likes you to throw a toy for him to catch). He also prefers many tiny meals throughout the day (his foster mom is training him on an automatic feeder). For his joints, he prefers low seating (like folded blankets on the floor or dog pillows) and will do best in an apartment/bungalow, rather than house with many stairs.<br />\n<br />\nShadow was abandoned by his original owners and living as a stray for many years. He has shown a bit of food aggression while with other cats, so is likely best as a solitary pet. However, he loves people. He always greets new visitors and is especially comfortable and affectionate with men.<br />\n<br />\nAs an older cat, Shadow has arthritis in his back hips and has started Solensia injections once per month to alleviate pain. For his well-being and quality of life, a potential adopter will have to be able to continue this treatment for him. A home with minimal stairs would be the best environment for him. Likely because of his arthritis reducing his activity, he is also slightly overweight and is currently on a prescription metabolic food to help him lose the weight to relieve the pain on his joints caused by his weight gain. Luckily, Shadow is the chillest boy and his foster has no problem putting him in the carrier or behaving at the vets.<br />\n<br />\nAs a senior cat, Shadow requires yearly bloodwork to monitor his health. His next test will be due in August 2024. Shadow also has some mild tartar and may require dental surgery in 2024-2025. Like all ACR cats, Shadow has been treated for fleas and parasites.

Luckily, she waited until she was safe to have her kittens, saving Shadow and his siblings from a life of uncertainty. Adopted as a kitten, Shadow is now back at EHS and is looking for the right home for him. He&#039;s a very sweet, good boy who loves his pets, follows his humans around, and responds to his name. Shadow is ideally looking for a more relaxed, stress-free environment (aren&#039;t we all, Shadow!). <br />\n<br />\nWe noticed that the shelter was a little overwhelming for Shadow, so he&#039;s now moved into a foster home, where his fun and friendly personality has clearly begun to shine through. Now, he walks confidently with his tail in the air and lays fearlessly in open spaces, though occasionally, he still gets startled by sudden noises or unexpected activity. A curious boy with an adventurous spirit, he loves prancing around and exploring every nook and cranny, high and low.<br />\n<br />\nThis gorgeous boy (and he knows it) spends much of his time admiring himself in the mirrors of his foster home. When he tires of this, Shadow enjoys sleeping in funny positions or letting you know it&#039;s time for food with some meows. Shadow is a big fan of affection and will head bonk for it (aww), but, he can get a little overstimulated when pet on his belly or near his tail. He might let you know when this happens by giving you a small hiss or swat, reminding you to respect his boundaries. <br />\n <br />\nShadow was recently returned to EHS due to having some accidents outside of his litter box. In his foster home though, he has been using his litter box regularly. In a quiet home, with patient and understanding adopters and access to multiple litter boxes, we believe Shadow’s accidents can be eliminated. Shadow would do best with a loving adopter who knows how to read, or is willing to learn, cat body language. He would probably be better off as a single kitty, and at this time we are unsure how he would behave around a dog or small children. <br />\n<br />\nTurn around, bright eyes! If you get a little bit lonely every now and then, apply to adopt Shadow so he&#039;ll come around and you&#039;ll both be holding on to each other forever! <br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

She resiliently fought through, and has overcome exceptional circumstances with her health! This stunning girl with expressive green eyes didnt know who to trust at first, but with time, shes realised that she can feel safe with people. Throughout the past year in her foster home, Shelby has come such a long way, blossoming into a calmer, more trusting kitty who seeks out affection and company! Shelby loves following her foster mom from room to room, curling up on her lap or by her feet for a snuggle session. Shelby greets her foster mom with kisses in the mornings and keeps her company, adorably snoozing on her laptop throughout the work day.<br />\n<br />\nShelby has also started to play with her foster family, excitedly chasing crinkle balls that are thrown her way. For a girl who has endured such a difficult journey, Shelby is quite friendly around new people, and will bravely greet guests in the home. She also makes for the purr-fect welcome committee, devotedly running to the front door each day as you arrive home! Shelby can get annoyed from prolonged affection or eye contact, instead preferring short cuddles and brushing sessions on the floor (instead of the chair/couch/desk) so that she can easily walk away. Shelbys other favourite pastimes include lounging on her beloved cat tower, and gobbling down delicious food! This girl has a fabulous appetite, and treats in moderation can be a helpful way for her future adopter to bond with her.<br />\n<br />\nShelby requires a patient adopter with a big heart in an adult-only home, who is willing to learn her unique body language and take the time to solidify a deep, loving bond. Shelby is so deserving of a devoted home where she can relax and shine as a cherished member of a fur-ever family.

I have a big purr and an adorable tiny meow. I love to snuggle and to make biscuits - that&#039;s what my foster mom calls my kneading!<br />\n<br />\nI have limited vision in my right eye, but it doesnt bother me at all. I think my wizard eye, as my foster mom calls it, adds to my distinguished look! It doesnt seem to affect my depth perception. I am very active - I zoom around when I feel like it, and I can jump up and down to the couch or bed with no problem. My foster mom has a flight of stairs at her place, and I can navigate those without any issue.<br />\n<br />\nI am diabetic, meaning that I need to eat low-carb food. (Don&#039;t worry, its not hard to find, and it&#039;s not more expensive than other cat food. My foster mom can provide a list of my favorite foods, including fancy feast pt wet food, and fancy feast pure treats!) I am very easygoing about the twice-daily insulin shots - no big deal!<br />\n<br />\nI am very calm about having my claws trimmed, as a gentlecat should be! I enjoy using scratching posts to keep my claws neat.<br />\n<br />\nI am FIV positive, but please dont hold it against me! FIV is not a life threatening condition, and it can only be spread to other cats through deep bites, which are exceedingly rare in neutered indoor cats. It requires no meds or special treatment, and FIV+ cats can have the same lifespan as cats without FIV. Cats with FIV and without FIV can reside together safely. You can read more about FIV here, or by looking it up online.<br />\n<br />\nI enjoy being petted and brushed. I&#039;m ready for a forever home that has lots of cozy blankets for me to burrow into, soft surfaces for me to nap on, and lots of affection. I like to be near my favorite person, sometimes on their lap, making biscuits! I enjoy playing with string toys sometimes, and have been known to partake in a little catnip on occasion.<br />\n<br />\nI have good litter habits (using an uncovered litter box.)<br />\n<br />\nI can accept the presence of other cats, and I prefer not to take a dominant role. Im also happy to be a solo cat. Im easygoing like that!<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Ive definitely had some challenging times in the past, resulting in my somewhat weathered/grizzled appearance, I am every bit the gentlecat. Im loving my life now and looking forward to enjoying life moving forward! My foster mom says Im the sweetest cat shes ever fostered - probably because I like to sleep cuddled right in her arms!<br />\n<br />\nMy biscuit-making is so great that my foster mom commissioned an artwork of me based on her favorite picture - me in a hat - to make a logo for my world-famous biscuit business. You can see the art if you scroll through the pictures of me here. (All credit to the artist: https://instagram.com/_kai_designs_/)<br />\n<br />\nI am loving and sweet.

She enjoys spending most of her day cuddled up in her cat bed or out exploring her foster home. However, she&#039;s still not confident with people and will keep her distance or retreat to safety if she sees people moving towards her. She&#039;s begun to accept pets with a back-scratcher, however, she seems to prefer when people just appreciate her beauty from afar.<br />\n<br />\nSpirit is a skittish cat who has had minimal experience with humans. With the help of a foster family, she is on a journey to adapt to a new environment and become more comfortable around people. Potential adopters should be prepared to commit the time, effort, and patience required to build Spirit&#039;s confidence and trust. It should be noted that while some skittish cats might remain reserved, others may express their trust and affection in a variety of ways. A skittish cat will benefit from a calm, quiet environment, preferably without small children. If needed, EHS will offer post-adoption support to assist Spirit with a successful transition to her forever home. Right now, Spirit spends most of her time curled up in a covered cat bed, but perhaps the right adopter will be able to coax her out of her shell so she can show off her true spirit!<br />\n<br />\nAre you in the giving spirit?

My foster mom is so nice and gives me fun crinkle toys to play with, and yummy food which makes me feel closer to her each and every day! Right now though, I still prefer to spend most of my time on my cat bed or perched on a ledge in the washroom, where I can oversee the fun that my foster family is having from a safe distance. Though I am still learning to trust, I will give my foster mom my sweetest meows so that she will keep the washroom door open, which helps me to feel included as part of the gang. I also love it when she keeps me company at bedtime - it helps me feel calm and I can fall asleep easily.<br />\n<br />\nI know that in time, I will bounce back into the energetic, playful girl that I was in Bahrain! I am looking for an adopter with a heart as big as my own, who can be patient with me and give me the gentle guidance and care that I need to thrive. Because of my initial bashfulness, I would be happiest in a quiet home without young kids, and with another feline companion who can show me the ropes.

With the loving help of her EHS foster families, Suki has come out of her shell and has become a much more social cat. These days, she actively seeks out the company of her current foster family for food and fun!<br />\n<br />\nSuki is becoming bolder and more vocal by the day as she realizes that indoor living has a lot to offer. Good times have never felt so good, as they say. She’s comfortable sitting on the couch with her foster family, especially if there’s a tasty treat to be had. Sometimes she wants a playmate, sometimes she wants to be near her people. Mostly, she just wants attention and she’s not shy about using her cute meow and her soft eyes as part of her charm offensive to get her daily quota of pets and scratches. When she gets the love she needs, she really leans into the affection and purrs with joy. We dare you to say no to this adorable little girl! <br />\n<br />\nShe’s a curious kitty who loves to investigate empty boxes for hidden treasures, chase the elusive laser pointer, and stalk her favourite catnip mouse. Suki is also very community-minded and keeps a “neighbourhood watch” from her window hammock, where she spends a good portion of her day. Suki’s ideal adopter will continue to build her confidence and encourage her playful nature to shine through.<br />\n<br />\nSuki would like you to know that she has FeLV and should therefore be the only cat in the household. FeLV poses no risk to humans or other species of animals; however, cats with FeLV have a suppressed immune system and have a greater likelihood of contracting secondary illnesses. Sharing a home with another animal risks exposing Suki to illness through that animal, as well as possibly contributing to a more stressful living environment. Some cats that have FeLV conquer the virus and recover, while others may have a significantly shortened life expectancy. So, how do you best manage the virus? By keeping Suki indoors in a stress-free, calm home, with good nutrition and twice a year, regular vet check-ups. Suki appears to have a regressive FeLV infection, which means she has lower risk of developing FeLV-related illnesses. Currently, she is healthy and does not require any medication. She is a loving cat, who is looking for someone to take a chance on her and understand that, whether she lives 2 years or 20, Suki has a lot of love to give and deserves a forever home just like any other cat. <br />\n<br />\nDoes sweet Suki sound like a perfect match for you?

She is built for the heat, sunbathing whenever a nice beam of light is streaming through the windows. An adventurer at heart, Sundae has been waiting for the opportunity to start her journey out in the world and share her sugary aura with the right family. <br />\n<br />\nThis little morsel has had her ups and downs while getting used to the luxurious life of a house cat, but Sundae has come a long way and is now showing off her energetic personality to everyone willing to watch. She plays out in the open with other cats day and night, often close to humans! Occasionally, she accepts chin and cheek scratches and leans into the back-scratcher. Although she can be a bit chilly at times, we know she enjoys affection, especially from other cats. Sundae is a bit clingy with her feline friends, waiting outside the litter box for them to finish so she can continue playing. She is set in her routines and won&#039;t let a little pause stop her fun. A hot summer day is best spent playing with toys and cooling off in the shade with Sundae! <br />\n<br />\nA sundae always starts off with a few frosty bites, but it begins to melt in no time at all, and the same goes for this lovely girl! Sundae is searching for a quiet and patient family that will support her and give her space when needed. It doesn&#039;t take long for her to warm up once she feels secure. <br />\n<br />\nWhen in foster care, Sundae loved the company of her roommate, always chirping, playing, and sleeping together. At the shelter she is still making friends, looking for a buddy to spend the time with. A home with another cat would suit her best, making it easier to open up and get more comfortable with humans. <br />\n<br />\nSundae may just be the refreshment you need to stay cool this summer, so submit your application today! <br />\n-------------------- <br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

Not only are the two of them the cutest things in the world, but Thomas is also a super sweet, affectionate, and playful guy.<br />\n<br />\nThomas and Hershey have been stealing volunteers&#039; hearts left and right, and after their move into a foster home a few months ago, they&#039;ve become the stars of our internal Facebook Group! These local celebrities don&#039;t let their fame get to them, and they always make sure to make time for visitors and potential adopters to say hello.<br />\n<br />\nThomas loves affection, toys, and Hershey (Hershey can fall in both the affection and toy category, as the two love to cuddle and play). Food very narrowly misses out on his top 3 favourite pastimes. When he&#039;s not cuddled up with Hershey or playing a game of tag, he loves pets and will roll around and soak up all the affection you have to give. He especially loves TV time, where he&#039;ll sit beside his foster, show his belly, and make biscuits!<br />\n<br />\nThomas has FIV, which is a virus that weakens the immune system of a cat. It is not transmissible to humans or other species. Cats who have FIV can live just as long as other cats if they are properly cared for with a good diet, indoor home, loving family, and vet checkups twice a year. Thomas does not require medication, but he&#039;d enjoy having another friendly FIV+ cat (specifically, Hershey!) to snuggle with in his new home!<br />\n<br />\nTreat Thomas and Hershey to a nice home to rule! Apply now, and Thomas&#039;ll give you his list of requirements for the house (which&#039;ll definitely include a nice and cozy bed for him and Hershey to snuggle in!).<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175.

Tofu chanced on such when she was rescued by a kindhearted person whose driveway Tofu visited on a daily basis to ask for food. According to her rescuer, Tofu is quite okay with calm doggie friends.<br />\n<br />\nTofu is a special older cat, and having a senior furry friend like her brings lots of good things. Seniors like Tofu have a way of making homes cozy and happy. She’s really polite and well-behaved, like a furry little lady! While she might not hop onto your lap, she’s super happy to sit beside you and wait for head and butt scratches – those are her absolute favourites! She is not shy and enjoys being the centre of attention. <br />\n<br />\nMost of Tofu’s day is spent snoozing, on a window sill, a soft blanket or a closet if she can get in; but sometimes, she’s a bit of a talker! She especially likes chatting around mealtime or when she’s feeling a little lonely. She’s also a great observer – she loves watching what you’re up to and hanging out right next to you while you work or watch TV. Tofu isn’t big on playing, but she goes crazy for catnip! She’s not a big fan of being picked up, but she’ll tolerate it because she’s a lady. You’ll never catch her hissing or swatting – she’s as gentle as can be! Tofu prefers a horizontal scratching surface when and if the infrequent urge crops up.<br />\n<br />\nShe’s got perfect manners when it comes to using the litter box and loves her wet food, pâté-style being her favourite. Lately, she’s been discovering how yummy Temptations treats can be too. Tofu does need a bit of extra care due to hyperthyroidism (twice daily medication) and her fussy appetite as she only eats wet food - while most of the time she has a hearty appetite, sometimes she goes on strike! As she is already quite petite, she needs a guardian who is attentive to her delicate nature.<br />\n<br />\nTofu apparently gets along with dogs, but not a big fan of cats.

Watching birds from the window while she basks in the sun is also a favourite hobby. We aren’t sure how Vashet is with other cats, but dogs are a definite NO!

Willy Wonka is a gentle soul and an irresistible cuddle companion. This handsome fella loves to be held, and will sweetly hop onto your lap or chest while you are relaxing with a good book or movie at home. Quiet nights are guaranteed to be heavenly with this snuggly boy by your side!<br />\n<br />\nWhen its mealtime, Willy Wonka can be quite a chatterbox, announcing his presence in the kitchen with his cute little meow! Tube treats can be used to entice this sweet boy from his hiding spots, and he will also gobble up his wet and dry food like an absolute star. As Willy Wonka is motivated by food, this can be a helpful way for his adopter to bond with him, along with play! As much as Willy Wonka loves to cuddle, he also enjoys the thrill of chasing wand toys or darting after a laser pointer! After months of attempting to climb his beloved cat tower without knocking it over, Willy Wonka has proudly conquered this feat! He now enjoys sunny afternoons perched atop of it, lounging by the window.<br />\n<br />\nWilly Wonka is seeking an adopter with a big heart who can help him manage his diabetes. This lovable boy requires insulin shots to be administered twice per day, which he takes like a champ. He was in remission recently, so we are confident that he will go into remission again and not need his shots - just his low-carb cat food, which can be purchased at any pet store (his foster mom can tell you his favourites!). Willy Wonka tolerates his treatment without making a fuss, which is all the more reason that he is such a resilient and special guy!<br />\n<br />\nWith his good-natured demeanour, Willy Wonka would thrive in a home as a solo pet or with another receptive cat. As he can lightly swat when he wants a little break from petting, Willy Wonka is best suited to a home without young children. Willy Wonka is a precious boy who has been through so much in his life. He has been in our care for over a year now, and has been overlooked time and time again by adopters.

He should not be left alone all day.<br />\nZayden charms every human he meets, but other cats find him just a bit too bossy. He would do best as a single pet. He is known to give little love nips, so he wouldn&#039;t be suitable for a family with young kids.<br />\nAdoption applications are available at http://www.forgottenones.ca/adoptions/. Please email the completed form to contact@forgottenones.ca.<br />\nAdoption fees are $250.00 for adult cats (one year and older), $300.00 for kittens, and $175.00 for senior cats (10+ years old).

Only one-year-old, Zelda is super affectionate. She LOVES pets and will flip, flop and roll all around the floor begging you not to stop. While she may not sit directly on your lap, she loves human company, rubbing against you while you touch and stroke her. A chatty girl, Zelda loves to vocalize her feelings for you as you give her scratches. Still barely a kitten, she thoroughly enjoys playtime! Toy mice, soft small balls and the circular track with the ball in it are her favourites. She enjoys sitting in the window, soaking up the sun and watching the comings and goings in the neighbourhood. As for food, seafood bisque food is her favourite! Zelda did not take long to warm up to her foster family, but like any cat in a new setting, she may be timid at first. Zelda is unphased by the resident cats and small dog in her foster home and may like another friendly cat buddy in her new home. She is good with kids too!<br />\n<br />\nZelda came to us after she showed up at a managed colony. Too friendly to be outside, we were asked to take her and help find her home at last. <br />\n<br />\nZelda will make a great addition to the perfect home with gentle humans who will adore and love her while giving her space and time to feel safe and get comfortable in her new surroundings. She will be expecting lots of pets and scratches!<br />\n\n    ","img":"https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/277942f5-fbed-47d3-8503-436d6b05d6e7/image/55d1e5b1-1cf0-4746-8c32-d54284aba65b.jpg?versionId=fuXAFq4LEb7CYyg368Ib6jjlSlOiFtLf&amp;bust=1720451000&width=300","url":"https://www.petfinder.com/cat/zelda-72320646/on/etobicoke/home-at-last-rescue-on624/","traits":{"playful":4,"affectionate":5,"sociable":4,"independent":2,"adventurous":2}},"ziggy-54749840.json":{"id":"ziggy-54749840","characteristics":"Yes","name":"ziggy","desc":"DOB: August 2020Meet Ziggy:<br />\n<br />\nZeroing in on Ziggy, saved with his three siblings Sweet Pea, Mr. Tibbs, Gandalf and their dad RumTum.

To make sure, he&#039;ll give head bonks and rub against legs. He definitely adores his people! He loves to snuggle first thing in the morning and enjoys sitting on any available lap throughout the day.  Ziggy forms strong attachments, and he doesn&#039;t love it when his foster mum leaves the house, but he&#039;s been learning that humans come back and he has become calmer during the day, often enjoying watching the goings-on outside from his cat perch.<br />\n<br />\nHis eating habits are another unique feature--you can sometimes find him fishing his dry food out of his bowl, enjoying each and every morsel. Ziggy is a grazer and likes to eat on his own schedule. A curious soul, he often peeks to see what delicacy his foster mum has on her plate once he&#039;s finished his own meal. All good Ziggy, your feistiness certainly helps you maintain your svelte figure (and batting balls around helps too)!<br />\n<br />\nZiggy&#039;s past encounters with the younger crowd are unknown, but we do know that dogs should not be part of any future dwelling. A family with older children will likely suit him just fine. Ziggy would like to be the only feline in a family who will provide him with the love and attention he craves, while encouraging his friendly, playful nature to shine through.<br />\n<br />\nWill you help Ziggy write his forever story? He would like the ending to read: &quot;And he lived happily ever after!&quot; Fill out an adoption application today!<br />\n--------------------<br />\nThe adoption fee for a single cat at EHS is $175. Take home an adult feline friend for your kitty and the adoption fee for the pair is $300! For kittens under six months of age, the adoption fee is $200...or, double your cuteness quotient and adopt two wee furballs for $350! If you mix and match (kitten plus cat), the adoption fee is $300. Each of our cats is spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, snap tested for FIV/FeLV, dewormed, and flea treated prior to adoption. Kittens are not spayed or neutered until 5 months of age, but the cost of spay/neuter will be covered as part of the adoption.<br />\n--------------------<br />\nInterested in adopting Ziggy?

Because she can get easily startled, speaking to her in a calm, gentle voice will help her overcome her fear. <br />\n<br />\nCuddly beds and soft blankets are a girl’s best friend, and Zoomer is no different.

They like to play together and cuddle together, they offer each other support when adjusting to a new environment. Both Gabby and Zoomer prefer to take things slow and need lots of patience and reassurance that humans can be their best friends. Gabby and Zoomer love to perch up by the window and soak up the sun while enjoying a nice nap. Their favourite toys are catnip mice, feather wands and rolling balls. In the evening before bedtime, Zoomer likes to watch her favourite cat TV show to ensure she gets a good sleep at night!<br />\n<br />\nWould you like to make Zoomer and Gabby a part of your family?
