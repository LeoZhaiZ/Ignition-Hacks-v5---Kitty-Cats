gemini.js - Where we used the google gemini API to get the description of 300+ cats on petfinder.com and created a script that would automatically convert all of the cat's descriptions to a scale for various traits from 1-5 (Affection, Playful, Sociable, Independence, Adventurous)

data.json - Where we stored all of the description and personality ratings of each cat.

index.html - Front-end of the website
